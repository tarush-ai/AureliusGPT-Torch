As it is most manifest, and easy to observe in the world; and to see it more and more in all men; even as it is also more manifest to see, that men do not know how to make a good use of it, and the common usage of men. For as they have a general opinion, that men will be very busy with their estate; that is to say, that men will be very much bent and busy on all things that relate to their estate and the estate of others: so have they a general opinion, that men do not take a proper and exact account of time; and that they do not use time for that which it was originally made and appointed for. For as the nature and constitution of all things in the world, are that the very use and occupation of a thing is that for which it is made; and that which is most proper and natural for anything, is that for which it is made and appointed, and that is the very true use and occupation of it: so it is with men also, and with time also; that is to say, the proper use and occupation of time is the proper use and occupation of men; that is, that they use it for that which is proper and natural for men to do <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger
Socrates.
If thou didst ask a man, how he didst make peace with his enemies, thou mightst learn from him, not how he made peace with them, but how he dealt with his anger. For if thou wilt not take care to deal with thy own anger, and if thou wilt not use all possible means for the removal and restraint of it, it will be thy own destruction. And in so much as any man deals with his anger, and that according to reason and justice, and with a right disposition of mind, in so much as that doth happen to him, there is no commonality: but only a difference in that. For as is the particular constitution of every man, so is the particular constitution of every anger: and as is the particular constitution of every anger, so is the particular constitution of every anger.

<BEGIN> How to face death?
A question that many of us have at some point pondered. Whether you're 20 or 80, the reality of death is a universal one. And yet, how many of us can truly say that we have thought about what we would do when faced with it? The question is, how can one truly be ready? What are the common ways in which we might face death? Death is a mystery and one that will have to be faced one day. When we consider the inevitability of death, what are some possible ways to deal with it? To some, it might seem an easy thing to face, but to others, it is a source of great fear. To be able to truly face death, one must first understand and accept it, for this is the first and most important thing that we must do. To truly face death, we must first, truly accept it. How many of us are able to accept death? If it is something that many people are afraid of, then it should be obvious, how difficult it may be for them to truly face it. Accepting death may seem difficult, but if one truly understands its inevitability, and truly accepts it, then it is truly a small matter. This, as the wise saying <END>

They are the great rulers and guardians of the human race, and of the commonwealth of men. And it is their duty, to defend and protect the truth. As the ancient Greeks were wont to call the philosophers, “the guardians of the state,” so also this generation of men do call the philosophers, “the guardians of the commonwealth.” — By what means, say you, have we received this name and title?

We are, therefore, to expect that their opinions and sentiments, as well as their actions and conduct, are governed, by the same principles of nature; which are the same in all rational beings.

And as to those, which they have by their own natural reason, and understanding, we are not to be offended at, and we ought to be justly offended at, and to punish those who are offended at them; but to have compassion, and to pity the offending person, as long as they are in their natural state, and not yet corrupted by some other cause. For all those things which are naturally, and properly human, we ought not to despise, and to condemn; and we ought to use them for the good of others. For example, that a man should eat meat, and drink wine, and smoke tobacco: if this be a proper thing for his natural nature, he ought not to be despised and condemned, but rather we ought to commend and praise him, for he doth use those things according to his natural constitution. And as for other things, which he doth use, that are not properly human, but rather proper to some other kind of animal, such as a horse, a camel, or an elephant, he ought <END>

In recent years, there has been a noticeable trend among young people towards self-acceptance. Many are now seeking self-worth and self-acceptance, as well as understanding and love for the self, which is the essence of what is required of us as a man or woman in this world. There is now more emphasis being put on personal happiness and success. This can be seen in the way in which they now pursue their passions and their careers.

Now, a number of people may not have taken notice of the fact that many of the most influential and famous men and women of our time, have in many cases lost their grip on reality. We can see this in the many cases of mental illness, drug addiction, and alcoholism, among the most influential and famous people. In the United States alone, for example, over 200 million dollars worth of alcohol is consumed daily, and this is only one example of the problems that many of our most influential people are facing. We see also the many cases of infidelity and sexual addiction, which is another problem that is very common among the most influential and famous people.

A friend, well acquainted with the natural world, was once at leisure to admire the beauty of the flowers that were in bloom. As he sat on a rock, his thoughts were not a little filled up with those things that he had heard, but could not yet know. As he sat, he was struck upon the head with a stone by one that had not the sense of peace; who said, “Why sit thou here and waste thy time?” To whom he replied, “I come hither, to find peace; that, like unto the stillness of the forest, and the quietness of the stream; that, like unto the gentle breeze, and the soft music of the birds, doth comfort and sooth my soul.” He then answered, “But is it not better to be busy; and to do something? For my part, I do believe it to be better, but yet I cannot, for my own part, find myself to be contented with anything but the quiet and peaceful state of the forest and the meadow.

<BEGIN> On the passage of time
The passing of time is a very difficult thing for a man, that is altogether sensible, and rightly grounded in reason, to bear and to endure. It is a thing, that is of itself of no small difficulty to endure; and for those that are not accustomed, it is not at all endurable. For as soon as the present moment, passeth away, it is immediately followed by a new present moment; and they that are not able to bear the present, cannot bear the following. And thus there is a kind of perpetual change in the world, which doth require great and constant endurance. The age of man doth always change, and every man, that is of a reasonable age, is now passing away; and the age that now is, doth pass away, as is wont and proper.

What then? shall I also be no longer of this age? For, if I die, it is not a matter of wonder, that the age doth change and pass. But, as I said before, if I should not die, what then? shall I still be of this age, and the world, which is now of this age, and the age that is now, pass away?

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is the best medicine. A wise man, who has not enough to say, will still be said to have many things to say.

To be silent is a sign of wisdom and of great good will, because it is the effect of a very great consideration and great deliberation. If one would but follow their own minds, he would be as silent as a statue; but they will not follow them.

What is the matter, then, which doth hinder them from being silent? The matter is this: to follow the mind. To follow the mind, to follow nature, and to follow God.

As a man who hath been well examined and learned in the schools of philosophy, will be silent as a statue; because he hath learned to understand the things of nature and of God. As he shall be able, he will be able to tell many things. But if he should follow the passions, he would be a madman; for he would be in the same disposition of mind, as if he were mad. So also, if a man follow not the things of nature, but follow only his own fancies and whims, he will be a fool.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain. It is a true pain, but not an unjust one. A true pain, that doth consist in a real hurt or hurtful quality, or matter, and not an imaginary or fancied hurt: for they that suffer from any real hurt, do bear some part of that pain. A hurtful matter, or quality, is that which, in its very nature, doth hurt. In itself, it doth not. In itself, it is nothing. It doth not exist, but when it doth hurt, and so doth. Therefore, if any thing doth exist, and doth exist in a real way, it doth exist as a real thing, which doth have a real existence, and doth exist, and exist in reality, and so doth have a real being.
Hence, the true and just pain, doth consist in this, that a hurtful matter, or quality, doth exist, and exist as a real thing, and as a thing in reality: and the just and true pain, doth consist in this, that a hurtful matter, or quality, doth exist, and exist, and so doth have a real being; and therefore the true pain, doth consist <END>

And if the same bodies were to be found again, in a different order, and in the same place, as if the order and place of all things were altered, there would be a great change and a great difference between the former and the latter; and that it must have been the way of a change that this world was made, which is still now as it was when it was made.

That the wrath that doth inflame the passions, is a most heinous and detestable crime, is a truth that need not be argued; but this, that the same wrath is not only heinous, but also a very hurtful and grievous evil, if it be suffered to continue for any considerable time, is a matter of great import, and that it should be immediately suppressed and suppressed, if the occasion be, is a truth that every man should know, who doth desire to be well-affected in this world. And first of all, he should learn, to deal with anger properly: that is, to get rid of anger as soon as it arises. For anger is a very offensive thing, both unto the angering person, and unto the person that is angry; and when it is suppressed, and kept down, it is a very profitable thing, both unto the one that suppresses it, and unto the one that is angry with him.

<BEGIN> How to face death as an individual
How to face death as an individual is not just a philosophical question but a personal one. This is not because of its philosophical nature but because we are all mortal. Therefore, we have to consider how we will face death when we die. To face death as an individual is to contemplate it as it will be with thee personally. It is not death but rather dying to do, and living to be. To say that we will face death with courage is a very good thing; but when we say that we will face death, there is not much in that. Death is not a thing that is to be faced. Death is not a thing that is to be feared, but a thing that is to be understood. Therefore, to face death as an individual is to understand it.

It was the custom of the Greeks and Romans, and indeed of many other nations, to make public declarations of their opinions, and the reasons for which they believed certain things to be true: This was their way of writing or composing themselves in prose. It was also a common practice among them to speak or deliver their orations to the people. For they did not believe it to be a matter of contempt or slight, to have an opportunity of speaking with a great assembly of men. For they did not believe that a true oration should be delivered by any one man or speaker, only, and not by a whole assembly of men, at one time. The Greek historian, Herodotus, also, used to say that the orator, and the philosopher, should be the same man, and that both should be able to speak, and to deliver themselves, in a way that would please all that would listen; and that it was not the same thing, to be able to <END>

## Abstract
Aristotle (384-322 BC) was a Greek philosopher. The Nicomachean Ethics is one of the most well-known works of the ancient Greeks and remains one of the most important texts in philosophy. In it, Aristotle deals with the subject of ethics and virtues. He also deals with other topics such as happiness, friendship, and the nature of man.

I must confess, I have never yet seen any person in love, who could be satisfied with the love of another, unless they also could return that love, or, as I may say, unless they could love him as well as themselves. For love, as it is generally understood, is a mutual love; and in truth, who can be satisfied with anything but the return of that love? And to this purpose I may give one example, of the common way that men do use those that have a great influence, or a great estate: they make use of their influence, or estate, to have their own will, and desires accomplished, but when their wills are accomplished, and their desires met, they are content to be rid of it. For instance, a prince, or a lord, that is content with nothing but what they can get, and have out of others; and that as soon as their wills are met, they do forsake their power, and leave their estates; as I have heard in particular of a duke. For to be in love, as I have said, is to be contented, but to be contented, is not to be in love. For as soon as this content <END>

The mind, when once it has reached the highest point of its power, is the more easily affected by external things, as well as by internal. This is why it is most proper and most natural that the mind, when once it has been affected by those things which it has been accustomed to be affected by, and has had its thoughts about them, and about the things which have caused it to be troubled, it should also be affected again by those things which are most proper and natural, and by which it should have been affected, but not been affected by those things which it has had as causes of its trouble, but those things by which it is properly affected and affected.

The world is so full of uncertainty and danger, that even if a man could have the utmost certainty and security in the world, he cannot but be afraid of the passage of time: For that is so far from him, and so far off, that he cannot reach it at all. For as the eye is not able to reach to the top of a very great mountain, and the ear is not able to reach to a very distant sound; so time is not able to reach the end of it.

But now, if thou wilt consider this, what doth it matter to a man, whether he be 50, or 70, or 80 years old? It is not so much as it is, for that it is the same as if he were 50, or 70, or 80 years old; and for that, the only thing is, that it be not more, or less, than the natural age of a man. For what man, that is of any age, doth not in the end of his days, find some thing which will be his death? And it is but a little while, before that, he finds it.

The endurance of pain is an extraordinary thing. If thou hast once seen a man who hath been stung by a thousand wasps, thou wilt find no wonder in his endurance of the pain. For that which is natural is easily to be endured, and to bear with patience and patience, that is the true measure of the courage of a man. For that which is not natural, that is a thing of wonder. For in a true man it is impossible to be deceived, but in a false and cowardly man it is easy to be deceived. For the true and courageous man is not ashamed to endure pain, and to bear it patiently, but the false and cowardly man is ashamed. Therefore the endurance of pain is a thing of wonder; and he is a coward who is ashamed to bear pain patiently. For pain and pleasure are the two opposite affections of the body; and for pain is appointed in order to be endured, and for pleasure to be enjoyed; but he that is afraid to bear pain, is not worthy to enjoy pleasure.

For he that is angry, is also angry for himself; but he that is not angry, is angry with none, and is therefore angry with himself. But as for anger against some other, this cannot be, because none of them is a kind of kinship to any man, that is, that any one of them can be a <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death in life or in time. - Aristotle.
To understand the nature of death in all things, first let us consider the nature of things in general. Things that exist naturally must have the power, not only of going, or coming, but of going back. For all things which exist in themselves, must be either living or dead; and of those which are not living, there is nothing more proper, than that they should be dead, or in a state of death; because all things which are not living are properly called dead.

That which is properly dead, is that which is naturally incapable of being either living or dead. But that which is capable of both, is not properly dead. For death is that which is capable of being, not of being. As an arrow that is once shot, is never again capable of being shot, but once shot, it is evermore incapable of being shot; so is death that which is evermore incapable of life; because death is that which is evermore incapable of being.

To the nature of things, is added that which is necessary, or obligatory. The necessary or obligatory is that, which is not of our own choice, but must be done; as the payment of a debt; the giving of a hostage; or <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless and why true fulfillment is only possible for those who are humble

Fame and the fame of men and women can be obtained by no other means, than by a true and constant desire, that all things may be according to nature, and that all things that be done, should be for the public good: and to preserve that good order, and harmony, that is in the world. And this can never be done by any, that desire fame and glory: For when they are ambitious, and bent upon their own praise, they do hinder, and hinder others to do the same. For every man that doth aim at honour, and glory, doth also hinder those that desire to live, to do as they will, and as they ought. And therefore, it is most unreasonable, that men, should seek to be admired, and celebrated by others. For it is not to be admired, to be admired and celebrated.

It is the common practice of all the ancient Greeks, and Romans, that they did not at all desire to be admired or celebrated, but to do the right thing. And what they did, was, according to nature, and according to the law of reason. And they that did not, was that they did not, as they ought <END>

What a wonderful thing, that, while one's body doth live and operate, yet the mind doth quietly and without noise or disturbance, still quietly work, as if it were at its ease, as if it had found that peaceful and quiet rest, that all the world's troubles and vexations could not trouble it. It is as if she had found the secret place of refuge, where she might safely and quietly lie down and rest, and there she should neither be troubled by anything else that the world could produce, nor by herself.

This is the peace of mind, which we so much desire: a peace of the mind, that doth quietly and quietly lie down and rest, and doth quietly and quietly operate; as if she had found that peaceful and quiet rest, that all the world's troubles and vexations could not trouble her.

For as we all know, there is a true peace of mind, which is not so much disturbed by external things, but so much by internal things. A certain quietness of the mind, which, as has been said before, is found in a true and real peace, and quietness of the mind, that doth quietly and quietly operate, as if she were at <END>

<BEGIN> On the passage of time. It is the natural course of things, for every living creature, to change and be changed, so that the world also may be changed, and that which is now old, become new, that what is new, become old. So that from the one part of things, it is not to be wondered that the world is continually in motion. And that it is not a new thing, which now happens to this world, that it is also to happen to the world to come; that those which were once old, may yet again be made old; that those which are new, may again be made old; that those that are new, may yet again be made old. So that that which is new, may again be made old, may be seen and understood. That it is not strange, that there are many things in the world, which are changed, and yet the world is not changed; that those things, which are old and yet changeable, may be understood by the name of those that are old, and yet remain to be.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is very much like the virtue of a wall; it must be silent, lest it should break. Or it may be compared unto the virtue of a door; it must be silent, lest it should be thrown open and be broken. The silence of the wall or the door is not to be regarded, but the silence of the man. And the same may be said of a bird or a beast; the silence of a bird or a beast is not to be regarded, but the silence of the man. For it is one thing, to be silent, another to be silent, that is, to be able to speak, but that is not silence; and another, to be silent, that is, not to be able to speak. For the latter is true silence.
And this is the reason why some men do not use the voice of a man. Not that their nature is such, that they have no voice; for they have a voice, as well as other men.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain, as it relates to the physical senses. By the term pain, we here understand a sensible disturbance in the body; not an emotional pain, or a mental pain, that is, a painful perception of an evil thought; but a pain that affecteth the body only, and is such as we commonly speak of.
Example 1: To endure pain is not the same thing, as to suffer pain. To endure pain is a sign of a man's patience; whereas to suffer pain is a sign of his weakness. As in the case of a soldier, that is wounded in a battle; he endures the pain, by his patience, but he doth suffer the pain, by his weakness; which weaknesse and weakness of soul, did occasion his being wounded. But he who doth endure the pain, is one who is patient, and strong. Example 2: A man doth endure his pain, when he is sick. A man doth suffer, when he is sick; that is, when he is not able to go on with his affairs. Endurance of pain, in this sense, is a sign of a man's health and vigour, but suffering is a sign of weakness.

And, also, it is best for our bodies and souls. (Book I, Chapter X).

From the preface of this very book, it may be seen, that it is not a common book, or one which the multitude, as they call it, is used unto; but rather one which is most peculiar to those who are learned, and who seek to be in those things that are peculiar unto them. And truly, for a man to seek after true knowledge; that is to say, to seek after the things that are true; and the things which are true; that is to say, to seek after those things which are and have been truly said; is a thing very hard.

Of those who have lived in great and ancient cities, some have said that they are not capable of living any longer, because their city is their mother, and the very earth which gave them life is their nurse. The very earth which nourisheth, which sustains, which increaseth, and which reduceth, is a true mother. As for anger, it is a certain kind of passion, and that which is most troublesome and troublesomest. For if any one be angry with another, he is in a manner a tyrant. If it be any more, or if any one be angry with his own self, then is he a tyrant indeed, or rather a mad man. The first is a tyrant; and that is a mad man. If he that is angry be angry for a particular occasion, then is the anger good; but if for a general occasion, then is the anger evil. A certain good, and a certain evil, are two things that differ. For the anger of a tyrant, or of a tyrant-like, is an evil thing. The anger of a tyrant is an evil thing; but the anger of a good man, that doth suffer and bear the anger of an evil man, is <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death? To die is to be free from pain, from fear, from all things which can hurt us; but to live is to suffer, and to be in pain and fear. Hence it is a very common question among the Greeks, and other nations, how to live, or how to die.
The first point to be considered, in order to make a good end, is, to be prepared for death. Whatsoever man is not prepared for death, he will never die at the right time. For as soon as a man is prepared, and ready for death, then death is not far from him. There is not one particular moment, or instant, in the course of nature, wherein any man is born; and there is not one particular moment, wherein any man dies. Every man dies some time or other; but no man ever dies at a particular instant. The death of every man, is some time or other, in the course of time.
Now if we will not be prepared for death, we must needs expect death; but if we be prepared, we shall not need to expect it. What is the best way to be prepared for death? It is, to live a good and a righteous life. To do no evil, to do all good <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is to assist others to do their best. He that doth his duty truly, he will find the world will also do its duty. But, when they that do their duty, find their duty hindered by others, the world being otherwise, they will not only find their own duty hindered, but the world's also, for they will see the same impediments that hindered their own duty. When a man is in the right, it is not for his own good, but for the world's. And, because they are both alike hindered, we must seek to do justice to the world, that we may be free ourselves. (St. Augustine.)
Tis not a matter of difficulty, but of indifference; because, whether they will do it, or not, we are not hurt by it. If it please them, it is for their own good; if not, we are not hurt by it. It is as it were, an accident to them; and if they do it not, we do it ourselves. (St. Augustine.)

<BEGIN> On logic and reason (1) — This question seems to have been borrowed from Aristotle. Some think that Aristotle first enquired of the Stoics about their opinions of logic; others suppose that it was Plato. For whether it were asked, either as a matter of curiosity, or of use, it is doubtful. For both have taught, and in their books have described the nature and essence of reason.
For some, it is matter of use; that the questions be inquired into, and the mysteries be resolved. But for the rest, it is matter of curiosity; that the reason be known, and the nature of things be understood; for by reason men are made capable to know those things which are not in our apprehension: and the nature of things to be known, is that they may be perceived, as things which are; and that which is, that it may be known.
Of all things that can be imagined, some are good; some bad: and the rest either indifferent, or indifferent. For there is nothing that can be imagined which is indifferent. But what is good is that which is to be sought after and pursued; and what is bad, that which is to be avoided.

And as a matter of fact, it is not the case that a faithful friend can be put to any test or trial; but all those things which happen to the faithful, are by nature and by reason of their own nature and disposition; and according to that which is and is not, in accordance with their own nature. The whole is a true and faithful friend. It is therefore impossible that it should happen to be otherwise, that is, that it should happen to be otherwise, that it should not happen to be otherwise, that it should not be able, and that it should not happen.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless: The case of Amy Winehouse
The tragic case of Amy Winehouse. Her untimely death at the age of 27 left an indelible mark on the world of music. It is worth noting that the world is still grappling with her death. The constant media frenzy that followed her death highlights the enduring nature of fame. Even though, in the years since, her fame has diminished to the point where she is no longer a household name, the memory of her remains etched in our collective consciousness. A few years after her death, Winehouse’s estate continues to generate revenue, which indicates that her legacy continues to be lucrative.
This example of Winehouse is a powerful example of why fame is meaningless. Despite the significance of her death, her fame has not had a lasting impact on the world. In reality, it is the world’s fixation on her death that is the enduring reality, not her fame. It is this fixation that will likely continue to endure in the future. Even though she is no longer a household name, Winehouse remains the center of attention due to her death. In many ways, her death is the only thing that is still making headlines today.
In conclusion, the case of Amy Winehouse serves as a testament to why fame is <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace and rest.
Peace is the quiet and rest of the soul; and the most general and natural, and ordinary state of it.
For all creatures that have souls, they must of necessity have some state of their souls, that is to say, some state of peace, and of rest.
It is a natural state; for the soul is not subject to any external constraint: and yet it doth need some state, and some rest, in order to its natural operations.
For if the soul, though subject to no external constraint, should not have some state of rest, it would be without action.
And it would not have action, but only passivity and mere potentiality.
And potentiality is not true potentiality; it is only potentiality of acting, but not of being acted upon.
And yet the soul is always being acted upon, both by the body, and by the mind. It is being acted upon by the body, in the same manner that the body is acted upon by the soul.
And it is being acted upon by the mind, in the same manner that the soul is acted upon by the body.
And of both, that is, the soul, and the body, do they not always depend upon one another, for their common operation? <END>

Now these men were those, who had a true and proper knowledge of the celestial bodies, and their motions, and changes; and also of their several places, and motions, and changes. To understand of this kind, were very few in the world.
From this it may be concluded, that the understanding of the motions and changes of the celestial bodies, and of their several places, and motions, and changes, was a subject of great and especial concernment. As it was a subject, of great and especial concernment, to a wise and knowing man, that was well-versed in the knowledge of the celestial bodies, and of their motions, and changes; and of their several places, and motions, and changes.

For as to any particular actions, and particular deeds; they are incapable, not that their actions are bad; but that they have not that certain fulness of power, that can do that which is done in any action, or deed. And it is the same as to those that are virtuous, who do all things. They are unable to do, or say, anything. For they do not make use of words; but if they do anything, they do it without words.

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life: Of which is not one, but many: either of the former, or of the latter kind, wherein is a shortness of life and death of life and of the soul. Of these two latter, indeed, there is no true death, only a change in life.

Of the former, there is nothing but a continuance of life, wherein is no shortness. But of the latter, wherein is a shortness, of the soul, indeed; yet, it is but a shortening and lengthening of the same. For if a soul were ever so much shortened or lengthened, it would be but a change, not a true death; for it is only a change of life. And, for that reason, a true death is not so much a death of the body, but of the life of the body; and a short life of that body is a short life of that very life of that body. So that, both for the life of the body and of the soul, that is short and dangerous which doth threaten the life of the body.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger in relationships
Dealing with anger in relationships is a challenging issue. When a romantic partner gets angry with their partner, it can be a very painful and difficult thing to deal with. Here are some steps one can take in order to effectively deal with anger in relationships.

The first step is to try and understand what is causing the anger. There are many factors that can trigger anger, and if you can identify these factors, you can then start working on them.

Another thing is to take responsibility for your own actions. If you feel that your actions are contributing to the anger, take responsibility for them. Apologize to your partner if necessary. The use of words such as "you always" and "you never" can lead to anger.

If your partner is angry with you, try to understand their feelings and perspective. They may be angry because of something that happened, and by showing them that you care and that you are willing to listen and work together, you can help to diffuse the situation.

Communication is also a key factor in dealing with anger in relationships. When you communicate effectively, you can prevent misunderstandings and resolve conflicts quickly and easily.

One should not try to suppress anger, but instead let it out in a healthy manner. When your emotions get the better <END>

It is not a thing that is either done or not done. If you fear death, remember that death is not done; if thou fear not, then remember that it is not done. Do thou use thyself for a work. A man who is troubled, and afraid, is not capable of any other work than his trouble and fear: but one who is at peace and free, is able to use himself for a thousand things. When a man is dead, he cannot be either a god or a man. He can have neither god nor man, nor any other name. He that is a god, is that who is without change and constant. He that is without change and constant, is he who is free. He is that who is freed from all fear, and from all care, and all disturbance, and from all anger: and from all anger, and from all wrath, and all rancor, and all indignation. A man, when he is angry, is a man no longer; but when he is free from anger, he is the true man. There are two things, pleasure and pain.

Fame can be a powerful social and cultural force, but it is ultimately empty and hollow. In the long run, fame will not save us from ourselves and will not redeem us from our own folly.
In a way, fame is like a mirror. It reflects the outer and external appearance of a person, without reflecting anything deep and fundamental. So much of man, so much of human nature, lies hidden, and cannot be reflected in that mirror. True beauty and true excellence, which are the things that give a true value to all the rest, cannot be reflected there.
We are as much fools, as we are wretched; and just as much undone, and undone, as we are happy. This is a truth that should be acknowledged and confessed. All of us, either now, or at some time, were fools and wretches. And if it should be so, why should we not say so openly and boldly? We are fools, we are wretches; and we should not hide it under a bushel, or in the shade; but be glad we are not as bad as other men, or as they themselves are.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence
Aristotle speaks of the virtues, and the four cardinal virtues, as virtues of character and disposition, which are essential to the moral order, as virtues of conduct and action. And thus there is a distinction to be made between them: the virtues of character, or the virtues of disposition, the virtues of conduct, and the virtues of action. Aristotle therefore distingueth between virtues of character, which are in the mind; and virtues of conduct, or actions of the soul: and he speaketh of virtues of action, which are actions of the soul. But the virtue of silence, which is a virtue of the soul, is not amongst them; and the virtues of the soul, which are actions of the soul, are not amongst them; nor are those, which are actions of the body; and neither is that of a good opinion, nor that of a good understanding, of those things, which the mind doth contemplate and behold. For all these, and those virtues, which I have spoken of, are amongst those things, which the mind doth contemplate, and behold; and this, which is the virtue of silence, and the virtue of good opinion, and the virtue of good understanding, doth also belong to those things, which the mind do <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain is a most excellent virtue, that doth never tire of the same thing; for pain, by nature, is such a thing as cannot be tamed, as long as it hath not been sufficiently endured. This virtue is also a great support to the understanding and the will: it doth open the understanding, and give it a free pass to penetrate into the matter; and it doth give the will and courage, to do that which is right, and to withstand what is wrong.
Some do object to the Christian religion, that the pains and torments of the soul in the life to come, are not consistent with the nature of man, nor with his endowments. But this objection is not of those that do dispute, but of those who do approve; for the pains and torments of the soul in the life to come, are as pleasant, and as agreeable to the soul, as any pleasure, or delight is in this life. For though the body, in the world, is subject to such pains and torments as are most grievous, yet the soul in the world, is subject to pains and torments, such as are most grievous, and yet, the soul is not affected. For the pains of the soul, are <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life.
By the shortness of our natural life, I have ever understood that it is our duty, to make as good use of it as we may. As many men do live and die in the very same time and place, where in their former lives and years, they lived and died in; and some men, have even in one and the same house lived in different ages of the world. (as, some men that were born, and died in the same house, 400 years after; or some that, as being born and raised, and married, in the very same year, yet, after a hundred and some years, their children grew up and were married in a different age; or some that, for want of knowledge, and good understanding, could not make any reasonable use of the time, that was bestowed upon them.) To make such a good use of time, and so good a life, is the only thing that can make such a life to be of any use.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger, and keeping the mind always free from it. It is the true temper of a good man, and the very character of the virtuous. Of this I speak, and of this alone. The mind that is full of anger, and anger only, is not the mind of any man, or any being whatsoever; because no man can be in two passions, at the same time: nor can any man be, at any one time, in more than one passion, but as the nature of the passions themselves doth require. If thou art full of anger, thou art not a man; if thou art full of fear, thou art not a man; if thou art full of lust, or avarice, or pride, thou art not a man. Therefore, thou must not only deal with the anger, but also deal with the cause of anger, and seek a remedy, as the nature of the cause of anger, doth require. Then, indeed, shalt thou be free from anger. For anger is a passion, and passions are the very things that a good man should be free from. Therefore, thou must not only deal with the passion, but also deal with the object of the passion; and seek a remedy, as the nature of the object <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death: A Christian’s meditation
Death is the great mystery and terror of man: yet the Lord's servants are not afraid of it. They rather look upon it, as the door of paradise. It is that door, which by which a Christian passes from life into death. This is the door of heaven, the gate of heaven: the door of heaven, through which he passes from this life into that. It is not the death of the body, but the death of sin. It is that door, through which a man passeth into a state of life, that is free and blessed. It is the death of sin. It is the death of sin. It is the death of sin. It is the death of sin.
For so shall they that fear the Lord be happy, as they that are in heaven. As those that dwell in the heaven. As those that are in the heaven. As those that are in the heaven. As those that are in heaven. As those that are in heaven. As those that are in heaven.

<BEGIN> On logic and reason
It is said of the great Aristotle: "To have a common and true understanding, and not to err." The thing, however, that Aristotle meant by common and true is not properly understood; and yet it is to be found in the same words by St. Paul. For he says: "Ye ought to seek to know, that ye may have common understanding and truth." (1 Thess. 5. 21, 2 Tim. 3. 7.) The understanding of the true, that is, of the common and common, is common indeed, but it is not found in all. For there is one sort of men, that are not capable of common understanding, or of discerning truth and falsehood. And it is true that all men ought to seek that common understanding, which is according to truth. For this is the natural constitution of man. And yet it is not so, that the understanding is common, in respect of knowledge. For the understanding is common indeed, in respect of the form, in respect of the faculties of the mind; but not common in respect of the matter. For the matter of the common understanding, that is, of the knowledge common, is proper and peculiar to each particular person. But it is not <END>

To consider these things is proper unto the understanding; and to consider them properly, is the proper exercise of it. The understanding, or mind, is not a matter of fact; nor anything which doth depend upon some external matter; or that can be perceived by any sensible organ. It is the spirit, that doth reside and subsist in the body: It is that which doth move and act, in the body. It is that which doth have and execute the thoughts, that is said to be <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless in the long run
Fame, popularity, and social status can all be fleeting and transitory, as we well know. They are often ephemeral and easily lost. It is wise to remember that these things are but fleeting shadows. A true and genuine happiness, that is not shaken by the capricious whims of others, is what we ought to aim at, and to prize in a good man. The latter, is an eternal and perpetual source of happiness, and the former but a temporary and fleeting pleasure.
This entry is based on a passage from John Locke's works, but the main author who is famous for this work is the English philosopher John Wycliffe, who wrote many a book. The main purpose of the author, in the matter of fame, is to set forth that which is most good for man, which is to live a life of true and genuine happiness, which is the true and eternal happiness. Now, this, is that which we call virtue.

And here are the words, Thou shalt find peace, if thou doest the things that I have commanded thee. For the grace of God, in Christ Jesus, doth teach thee how to find peace; and doth give thee peace; and is the author of peace. The peace of the saints is the peace of the gospel. Hereupon the apostles and prophets speak in one accord, in the words, We all have all these things common to us; the peace of Christ is common unto us. Let this be the thing, which thou doest first, and then thou shalt have peace in the world; for if thou be at peace, and dost not offend, the world doth not offend thee.

Of the passage of time. It is necessary for me to speak unto you concerning this also, as the time is short, and all the world is in great perturbation: for this cause many of them that are of other sort, and more stiff in their belief, do endeavour to divert them from this matter, as being very dangerous. For they, that are so bent and set upon a contrary belief, do endeavour to hinder those, that do embrace this true and blessed belief, from speaking and teaching of it. But what, say ye, doth hinder them so from doing what they should? Why, there is that hindereth; it is the devil. For he doth hinder, and hindereth those, that are in the way, to embrace the true and blessed belief, and to follow after that which is righteous and holy. And therefore it is necessary for thee to know the truth of this matter: for thou must know it. But tell me, how doth it come to pass, that there are so many of them that do deny it? For what cause is it, that they do so? It is, forsooth, because of the devil and his deceivers: for they have taught them to <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is not to be confused with the absence of words. The one is not the same as the other. It is to be able to say that which is true and proper, and to be silent when that which is not true, is either spoken, or by the mere operation of the mind, is conceived. Of this latter kind, are those things which are conceived by the mind. For although a man speak many words, and a multitude of words, yet if that which is conceived by the mind, is not expressed with words, that is not silence; and it is not the fault of the words which are expressed. But in things which are to be expressed, if that which is conceived by the mind, be not expressed, that is the fault of the mind. And in this manner, of things that are conceived by the mind, to express the truth and propriety of things. Or again, if that which is true and proper, is not expressed.

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life in man.
The shortness of human life is a common subject among the philosophers, and is dealt with by many of them, even in their several discourses. Of this subject, therefore, I have already made some remarks: and therefore I shall not now go into such a particular discourse again. I shall, however, observe that it is a matter of fact, not of opinion or belief; because that which is not of opinion or belief, must either be done, or cannot be done at all. I have already, however, observed that the human life is short, and therefore also the duration of the human existence. For if the duration of the human life be short, the time of human existence cannot be long. For of anything that is not of opinion or belief, this must be done; that it either is, or is not: therefore the time of human existence is short, and the duration of human life short.
But it may be said, that if men would only consider the particularities of human nature, they might perhaps be persuaded of the shortness of the human life, and therefore the shortness of human existence. For in what man are there not particularities of nature and constitution? and is not human life also particular to each man, and <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger and other emotions, a man should consider these three things. Firstly, the natural disposition and tendency of the passions. Secondly, the use and office of each particular passion, and the way in which it is directed; and thirdly, the effects of those passions. (Stoics)

Firstly, natural disposition and tendency of passions, etc.

The question, how it should be directed, is not altogether unknown; for it is according to reason that passions should be directed, either towards their proper ends, or away from those which are contrary to them. But of these ends, and those which are contrary to them, we have either no knowledge, or not enough knowledge: therefore of their nature we must be persuaded by our common sense and common reason; as may be seen of the nature of anger, of fear, and of any other passion whatever.

Secondly, the use and office of each passion, and the way in which it is directed; etc.

But for this also we are to use our reason. For either we are able to find out, and to know, what is the proper end of the passions, and how to direct them: or if it be not so, we must not think ourselves very wise in a matter, of which we know nothing <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death, the very essence of death, with a cheerful disposition and a loving spirit? (Hymn 61). It is a matter of common knowledge, that death is not a matter of mere fear; for it is a thing that cannot be avoided. But it is not a matter of mere fear, nor of mere indifference, but of a proper disposition and preparation, both of body and soul. Therefore, when we must needs die, let us not be dismayed or afraid, but rather let us cheer ourselves up, and put ourselves in mind of all those things which are good and holy. (Hymn 61)
This passage is a fragment of a hymn. It discusses the theme of death and how one should face it. The speaker seems to be arguing that the fear of death is not something to be feared itself, but rather the idea of death as an inevitable part of life is something that can be accepted and prepared for. The speaker encourages the reader to prepare themselves mentally and spiritually for death, and to focus on the good and holy aspects of life. The speaker suggests that the reader should be cheerful and loving when facing death, rather than being dismayed or afraid. This is a theme that is often discussed in Christian theology and literature, as death <END>

On the subject of divine Providence, he is not so much persuaded, that the God of the Scriptures is not able to govern his own actions, and the actions of others. His opinions are rather that, when men, and particular men, as well as nations, are governed by God, they must, after their own natural course, be governed; and that he, who governs, is the God of the Scriptures: But that, by some means, he, and those, who do obey him, must, after their own natural course, be governed also by his other hand, and that other hand is not his, which he doth govern himself with. This may be applied to men and nations, that the God of the Scriptures governs, and governs, but doth not govern himself with, and that the God of the Scriptures, doth not govern himself with, and that other hand, which governs, and is not his, is that of Satan.

he, as is commonly supposed, made a most violent and furious speech, as if to provoke a quarrel. Now this was very unjust to all men, who are not his enemies; and to all women, as also to the rest of the world. For how can any man be of an evil disposition, that is to say, cruel, and that which is called hatred? When even the gods, that are of the highest order, are not hated. But he did this, as it is said, by some certain natural cause, that he was naturally apt to do and say evil things.

This man, therefore, is not of such a nature, that he is naturally disposed to do and say anything that is either bad, or to do any thing that is contrary to the law of nature; but he is of such a nature, that he is naturally apt to do and say things which are contrary to the law of nature, and that also he is naturally apt to do and say those things, that he should be hated and detested of all the rest.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless: A Buddhist perspective
Fame, a term that has been used to describe success, is, according to Buddha, a mere illusion, devoid of any substantial value. It is the creation of human fancy, the creation of the ego, which we call "I". For a Buddha, fame is simply a false notion, a mere fancy of the human mind; a mere appearance. What is it that we desire in truth? What is it that we do in truth? Is it not a mere appearance; a mere fancy?
Buddha says, 'the self is nothing; all things are self. All things, therefore, are equal.' The ego, which is the source of our desire for fame, is not true. What is true? What is real? 'Thy name, O Buddha, is but a mere appearance; thy form is but an appearance.' 'All appearances are but appearances.' All appearances are but appearances, and all things, but appearances. So is the world, as such, a mere appearance; a mere fancy.

This is what they are to be found, or how they are to be found: to find out the will of God, to understand his mind, and the nature of things; to have an understanding of all things; to know and be able to answer, in season and out of season, for the consolation and comfort of other men. What is the way of finding out this peace, and that knowledge, and understanding, which is the fruit of such contemplation? We must be careful to take heed of ourselves; and to look to ourselves; and not to the things themselves. For, as the Scripture saith, 'If it were not so, thy heart should be wicked: Thou shouldst not be one of the wicked, but of them that keep the law.' For how can that be, which is not in the law, and in the rule? How can that be, which doth not correspond to the law and the rule?

Treat both these as mere conceits, and the one as a kind of allegory, and the other as a matter of fact, which is now to be proved. That which is proper unto thee, is thy own. What is not proper unto thee, is not thy own. To love one's self, is that which is proper unto thee; to hate, that which is not proper unto thee. This also is to be understood; that the soul is properly a certain and peculiar form, and matter of all things. This matter and form is not common to any other thing.
Of the first part: to love one's self, is to love a man according unto his proper nature. A man proper to love is he, whom he finds goodly, or beautiful; that is to say, a man that doth deserve to be loved. For it is not without cause that a man is goodly or beautiful; but for the same reason that a man is goodly or beautiful, he doth deserve to be loved. But this is also true, that he who is loved is a goodly and beautiful man. This also doth deserve our love. For it <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain or hardship.

Examples:

*   The soldiers endured a great deal of hardship and pain.
*   The athlete endured a great amount of pain during the competition.

The word "endurance" in this context means the ability to withstand or tolerate pain or hardship for a long time. The word "pain" is a noun referring to a feeling of distress, discomfort or suffering.

This context does not involve endurance in a physical sense. In this context, endurance means the ability to withstand or tolerate mental hardship and pain for a long time.

This context is not physical. In this context, endurance is not related to a person's ability to withstand physical hardship or pain, but rather the ability to withstand or tolerate mental hardship and pain. Therefore, the correct usage is "the endurance of mental pain or hardship". The correct answer is "endurance of mental hardship." <END>

And how doth a man know, what the world is, and what are its true causes, unless he read a great many books? A man who hath read one good book, and read it thoroughly, is able to answer all sorts of questions: but a man who hath only read one, or two, books, or a few, doth not know the true nature of anything. For that they are of what sort and what quality, who hath not read many books, is not known, and cannot be known; because they are of such sort, as that they cannot be known. Therefore let this be as a warning unto thee, O man, thou hast not time to read a great many books, as the constitution of this flea is. Thou hast but a short time of life; and if thou use it, in no other thing, than in reading many books, and in learning all sorts of things; thou shalt be well used up, in that short time; and then thou shalt be no more.

One must be patient and kind and temperate, even in the midst of angry and bitter strife, and one must never be moved by any occasion, and never be angry. This is the way to be a good man, and to live a happy life. And one must not only be free from all anger, and all passion, and all disturbance of the mind; but one must also be free from all wrath, and all envy, and all other evil motions of the mind. This is the way to be truly happy, and to be in a good disposition. To deal well with anger is very difficult; for it is a very troublesome thing, that doth trouble the mind, and doth hurt many, and is very dangerous. For it is a sign of a man, that is not honest, that is not just, and that is not a good man, if he be angry, and that doth not know how to control and to govern himself. To deal well with anger, is to deal well with the wrath of God, and to keep our hearts, and minds, and consciences pure. This is the way to be a true follower of Christ.

Of a true and perfect death, nothing can be said, or understood, either from a rational consideration, or from any experience and observation, that can possibly be gathered by reason.

Hypatia, being put to death, or rather executed, for her religion, in a most barbarous and inhuman manner, by the order of Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria, according to the common reports and histories of the times, did not at all express any thing of sorrow, or grief: but the contrary, she expressed a full satisfaction and contentment with her death, as was truly proper and right, for a man of her piety and piety.

It is true, the fear of death is natural to man, as a creature of God, that is, according to the common opinion of the ancient Greeks; and in particular, the fear of death is natural to that man, whose religion is according to the true faith.

In matters of religion, morality, and philosophy, there are two things to consider: the nature of the subject, and the manner of treating it. The former is not capable of being changed by any man, and yet it is very proper and reasonable that a man should be able to determine it, either for himself, or for others; and if any one doth differ from the common opinion, that is not of himself only, but for the good of all, who have not the same opinion. The latter is indeed capable of change, and therefore every man ought to be able to change his mind. It is very reasonable that men should not be afraid of changing their mind, and that the first opinions of a man should not be considered as authoritative. The truth of a matter is not so much to be doubted, as whether one may be contented and happy without it, or not. If a man doth embrace a false opinion, he doth not do it for himself; and if he doth embrace the truth, it is for the happiness and good of all, who are to be contented and happy without it.

<BEGIN> On finding peace in the midst of chaos
When faced with adversity, it is easy to become overwhelmed, and our thoughts become consumed with the problem at hand. But if we are able to remain calm and composed, even in the midst of great turmoil, we find peace.
One of the great mysteries of the universe is why some men can remain tranquil in the face of adversity, while others are completely thrown into a state of panic.
In the first place, the tranquillity and peace of mind that is possessed by one who is free from the fear of God, and from the fear of men, must necessarily be the cause of a tranquil and peaceful mind; for a man, who is truly afraid of God, will have no other object of his thought than the fear of God; and he will not think of anything else. And again, a man, who is truly afraid of men, will be so affected by their fear that he will not think of anything else. But those who are not afraid of either God or men, must necessarily be free from the fear of both.
But this, which we have said is true of those who are afraid of both God and men, is also true of those who are afraid of either God or men. For there is no such thing as <END>

Thus the heavens have a proper motion, and to that end that they be moved, which is, the sun, the moon, and stars, and all the other celestial bodies to shine, and to govern the world of things, and all things according to the natural order and disposition of the universe. And that also of the waters, and the plants, and all the rest, that all things do move and go on, that they do their proper work. For that they move, and that they do their proper work, is in some way, or other, an end, that is proper and natural to them.
The question of the proper end of their motion is therefore the proper end of their whole nature.
In other words, we should inquire and examine the matter in this way:

For that is nothing, that is done, but that is much, that is said; and therefore that is more, that is said, than that is done: because it is that which is said, which is a matter of conscience: and that is, to be always in the right; and to be always obedient to the commandments of God.

St. Catherine of Siena had a great passion, a true and natural passion, for the glory of God: but she was not a little affected, by the cruelty and the malice of her enemies; and she was so much distressed, by the pains and torments, which she endured of the devil, that she could not endure any one to comfort her; for she was so deeply affected, that she could not bear the presence of any one.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger and anxiety: A Buddhist teaching
In the midst of life, when men are vexed with anger, and anxiety, and fear, and a thousand other passions: and when men do cry, and lament, and make lamentable speeches, and many such like things: this is the way, and true way of dealing with such persons, to receive them with gentleness and mercy, and to hear them, with a willing and an humble mind... and to correct them, without the use of severity or violence, but with patience and gentle reproof.

— William Tyndale

This verse is part of the first lesson in The Book of Common Prayer. Tyndale's translation of the Bible reflects his deep respect for the Christian tradition that has come down from the apostles, including the early Church Fathers like John Chrysostom and Jerome, who were known for their wisdom and pastoral care. This passage is a meditation on the ways of the heart, as taught by the saints. In this sense, it is not simply a teaching on how to deal with individuals who are angry and anxious. Rather it is a reflection on the nature of the human soul and how we might cultivate the virtues of compassion and patience.

Facing death is a difficult and challenging process, but it is also an inevitable part of life. Here are some steps you can take to prepare yourself and cope with the reality of death.
Understand death and the dying process: Knowing what to expect during the dying process can help alleviate fear and anxiety. Understanding the natural process of death and the emotions of the dying can help you cope with the situation.
Seek medical attention if necessary: If you are terminally ill or have a life-threatening condition, seek medical attention. A doctor can provide you with treatment options, pain management, and palliative care to improve your quality of life.
Talk to loved ones: Death is often difficult for loved ones to cope with. Talking to them openly and honestly can help them understand your wishes and emotions. Consider having an advance care directive, such as a living will or do not resuscitate order.
Consider spiritual care: Spiritual care can provide comfort, solace, and meaning to the dying process. This can include chaplaincy, pastoral care, or spiritual therapy.
Practice mindfulness and relaxation techniques: Mindfulness, meditation, and relaxation techniques can help reduce anxiety, stress, and pain.

They prefer their imagination, as one that doth possess them with all the faculty of fancy, but that which is reasonable, and that which is true, they neither know nor care about. The latter is not their business; the former is. The imagination is, if I may so say it, the only faculty that the soul doth possess, for which, she hath a true and faithful servant, namely the imagination; which, if rightly used, doth perform all the offices that the soul hath need of. To them, however, who are fond of their own fancy, I must say, that they will find their fancy to be an idle fancy, when it shall be no longer sufficient, and shall not be able to do anything.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
The pursuit of fame is a never-ending and relentless pursuit. It's a quest that is both elusive and alluring. Some people are so fixated on the idea of achieving fame and recognition that they lose sight of what's truly important in life. But fame is often fleeting and ultimately meaningless. Here are some reasons why:

1.  **It's transitory:** Fame is not permanent. It can quickly come and go, depending on circumstances beyond an individual's control.
2.  **It's shallow:** Fame is based on superficial characteristics like physical appearance, popularity, or fame. It doesn't measure a person's true character, integrity, or achievements.
3.  **It can be misleading:** Fame can be a misleading indicator of success or worth. A person may be famous but still unfulfilled or unhappy.
4.  **It can be a distraction:** Pursuing fame can be a distraction from one's true passions, goals, and values. It can lead to a sense of disconnection and fulfillment.
5.  **It can be harmful:** The pressure to achieve fame can be harmful to mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and burnout. The pressure to conform to certain standards of beauty or success can be harmful and damaging.

Time itself is not so much to be wondered at as it is a thing of the most ordinary and natural kind. The course of time is that of all other things that are subject to change. All things subject to change, it is plain, are subject to all kinds of things which can change them. The power and faculty of time itself are also subject to all other things, which can affect it: so that if anything can change time, it must be according to some natural cause or power of something that is subject to change. In the course of time, also, is it that which is subject to change, and not time itself, that is changed. It is that which is subject to change, that changes. But this is not so much a matter of wonder, as it is of the common nature of those things, that are subject to change. For how can it be, but that what is subject to change, doth change? And what, is changed, can it not be, but by the power and faculty of those things, which are subject to change? Of these things, the wonder is not so much, but that any of them can change.

Pain, according to some philosophers, is a kind of torment or punishment of the soul. For if any man is grieved and distressed, is that not a kind of torment and punishment to the soul? If, therefore, the soul is a perfect and excellent thing, how long can it be able to endure pain? For pain is not a thing to be borne, but rather to be shunned. And what is the cause that the soul cannot bear pain, that she doth suffer, as is the common opinion, and it is the reason of her being subjected to pain. This is true, and it is well known. The cause is the following: that as man's soul is a divine thing, it is not to be borne and endured for long time. For as soon as it is once subjected to pain and torment, the soul doth immediately begin to desire its deliverance. Therefore, pain is a kind of torment, or punishment, which the soul doth suffer. But as soon as the pain doth cease, and the pain ceases, the soul doth desire her deliverance from pain.

And as for those that are angry, and of a cold, and slow temper, they must not only beware of this corruption, but also of a slow and sullen disposition. For to be cold and sullen is a sign of a dull and sluggish mind: which is the same as a dull and ignorant head.

A little while ago I made a discourse of this nature.

As for the earth and all earthly things, it is manifest that their dependence is very small. For we have all things under our hand; we can do all things, so as the will of God shall be. And so will he do also, so as our wills be.

A man was going over a rickety bridge which spanned a wide and deep river. He was in a great hurry; and while he was thus crossing, the bridge gave way under him. As he fell through the air, he was much astonished to find himself again and again turning round about in his own mind, and wondering how it could be that the whole universe was filled up with such strange and unaccountable things, and yet he had not yet been able to make anything of them all; and so in particular, how the particular case of his own death should be brought to an end, and the particular case of his own life to be concluded, when yet there seemed no end of the particular case of his own life; and what death, that most natural and ordinary of things, did that also contain; and of this that was most peculiarly and peculiarly his own? 

And hereupon the man began to think of death and of the mysteries of the world. He asked himself, what is it that death is? And what is that which shall follow death?

To be always at peace and quiet, is to be always free from those perturbations of the mind which arise from anger, jealousy, or fear. For it is not the presence of evil itself, that doth hurt, but the imagination that doth make it hurt. For when our imagination is not set a-running, with false and erroneous conceits, our peace is not troubled.

Now to make our imagination quiet, is to make it to be free from the imaginations of those things, that are not. And to set it a-running with false conceits, is a thing most vile and wicked.

It is also an evil and a corruption to be carried away by a crowd; but it is better to be borne, and to be borne in silence, if any man suffereth a wrong. For the true wisdom and the true knowledge, is that all things do perish and pass away. And that of themselves, and according to their nature, they do perish and pass away, but it is not an evil thing, if they should perish and pass away, according to their nature; but it is a thing most grievous and most loathsome, for that to perish and to pass away, is it not that they should be according to their nature <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence, that is, the abstinence from speaking, when not necessary; and the abstinence from speaking too much, is a part of the same virtue. The practice of the former is called stoicism; and that of the latter, discretion. Both, however, are virtues of the same kind, because both are the practice of such a disposition, as may well bear with itself all the afflictions that the world may bring upon it. For one must bear with himself many things that are troublesome, and that he may not be always in a tumult, and a noise; that the things that are truly troublesome and grievous, may be able to bear themselves.

This is the way in which it should be, that a man may live in harmony and concord with the universe, and with the nature of things; and may be at peace with all things, that are to be.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger.
How can a man deal with anger? This is the question which is always present with men in their minds; but there is none of those which can answer it, but by way of conjecture. That which is, is not certain, that which is not, is not doubtful; but all that lies between, is subject to many interpretations, and many objections. To speak generally, the best way to deal with anger, is not to anger; for this is the root and origin of it: and if we do not anger, then is not anger. And it is not strange, that this be so; for anger is but a kind of passion: and as for passions, they are not things of reason or of nature, but of fortune and of accident.
To be angry, is to be discontented, and to desire to be so, is not the thing of reason. Whatsoever is the contrary of passion, is the thing of reason and of nature. And therefore it is necessary, to make use of reason and nature, to deal with passions.
The first and most certain way to deal with passions, is to make use of reason, and to understand and know them. For of a thing, which is not known, it is not possible to deal <END>

In a great desert, where it is impossible that there should be any earth or water, there are some stones or rocks that are not covered with sand, nor any part of them that is covered with sand. These rocks, if they be taken up, and carried away to a place a great distance off from the desert, they will not be covered again with sand; because sand is only spread out to fill up the space; but the rock itself remains the same.
Thus, as thou wilt find the same matter of earth or water, covered and uncovered, in some stones and rocks; so thou must find in the universe, that there are some parts which are not covered or spread out in all directions. And for those parts which are covered and spread out in all directions, thou must find that they are also parts of the universe: for the universe is not to be thought of, as a single mass of all things; but rather as a common whole; wherein all <END>

To face death with courage and confidence is one of the most important virtues, for a good life cannot exist without death.

And as the end of a life is its final and ultimate end, that which is in the power of men, must not only be well managed, but also be brought to pass. Let them, that are able, do the best they can; and if any other have so much power, let them not do it: but if not, as to do anything at all, so let them as for that reason which doth move them, so they do, according as God shall be pleased: that is to say, if God shall see fit to give them a certain span of time for the fulfilling of all their duty; and that is all they are bound unto.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless and why celebrity is a curse, by William James
by William James (1842-1910)

In this meditation, Mr. James expresses a view which might seem strange to many people. That fame, however it be, is in fact a curse to him. He cannot conceive how it should ever have been regarded, as a desirable or excellent thing. Here again we see the power of the soul. As the great man says in his Book of Common Prayer, “When the flesh is come to the fullness of age, the soul of a man begins to be sensible and to know the true nature and character of himself.” The human soul is thus soon convinced of the folly of human pride. As we see from Mr. James’s own writings, the world, or rather the human mind, is governed by the nature of things, which are governed themselves by reason and order, not by the mere will or pleasure of any one man. If the whole of things had been left to human will and pleasure, there had been an endless tumult, an endless disorder. As it is, by the assistance and guidance of reason and order, and by the obedience of the universe, we find in this world that order and harmony, and in the future that which is proper and <END>

This is also the case in general, of all men that are in the world, for they are either in the state of a man, or that of a woman, or of a child, and in one of these three states they are not in such a condition, as that they should be at peace, or in a true sense of peace, with others.

Till then the mind was in love with pleasure, and sought to multiply it: and had they been at their own liberty, she would have taken all that the world had ever given her, and been contented. But she was put into that state by the will of another: she was to beget and bear, and not to multiply pleasure, nor to be contented with herself, till the world had been made. And thus we may say, that it is the nature of man to be discontented, and that it is necessary for a man to be contented, and to have his contentions put to silence. But what is content, that may be put to silence, but that which is according to the right and proper nature of man. And that which is according to the right nature of man, must be according to the will and intention of God. Therefore we must be content with our lot, and with that which God hath given unto us, and must not seek, to make that better which God hath made, better. And so we must be content, with that which we have, and must not strive, or seek, to have, that which we have not. And so we must be content, with that which we can do, <END>

For to a man, that hath not a present end of things to come, it is well and sufficient, so that he live well for this end of his; but if that end is not known, then there must be either no end at all, or a long end.

Now thou must be of the understanding that anger, in sooth, doth work many evil deeds. For it is a blind passion, and as such, it is much more pernicious, than wrath or ire. And in sooth, anger is a more cruel and savage creature, than either wrath or ire; and it is this for this reason: because anger is the wrath of the heart, without understanding. For in all wrath and ire there is understanding, and in anger there is none at all. And therefore, if thou wilt not suffer anger to enter into thee, thou must not suffer wrath or ire. For, as I said, both these are passions of the mind, and there is nothing worse than anger, when it doth enter into thee, for that is to be a mind full of hate. And this is the reason, why thou must not suffer anger to enter into thee; that thou mayest not be a mind full of hate. Now, I know that this is a difficult matter to manage, but I will not be deterred. And to help thee to do this, I will say that thou must always remember, that thou art a servant of God, and a servant of thy neighbour <END>

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe, there are two kinds of philosophical opinions which have prevailed, that it is eternal, that it is corruptible. This is the difference that hath caused a great part of those controversies which have arisen between philosophers and men of religion, who, from their views, either regard the things of heaven as corruptible or as eternal.
Now let us begin to examine this matter of the universe. We know that the whole world, the earth and the sea, doth in their ordinary course of motion, pass by as it were in a moment. And there are no two things in the whole world so as to be separated and separated so as to be together for ever and ever. Yet doth the earth and the sea together form that whole which the poets, in their description of the world, called the universe; and yet are not eternal, yet not corruptible. For the earth doth in the course of time, as the philosophers say, decay and pass away; and the sea also doth overflow, as the philosophers say, and go away; and all other things, both the earth, and the sea, and the whole world, do in their ordinary course of motion, pass by, and go away, for ever and ever.

<BEGIN> How to face death

Many people do not know what to do with themselves in their final hours, because they are afraid of death, and they are uncertain about what to do or what to say in those last hours of their life.

In the Christian faith, the last hour is called a "time of conversion", or "a time of repentance". When the soul is departed, and the body is dead, there is an immediate union of the two; the one soul is immediately united with the other; and this union is eternal.

This is not a time of judgment or condemnation, as some imagine, for the souls of the righteous are in the presence of God, and are blessed in their souls; and the unrighteous are punished according to their sins, and are comforted in the presence of God; and the whole creation is set free.

There is no need for man to be afraid of death, as it is a time of joy and comfort. The soul, having left its earthly body, is immediately united with the body of Christ, and with the souls of the righteous, and is blessed and comforted in the presence of God. And this union is eternal and permanent.

Therefore, when a man is dying, he should not be afraid, but rather should be comforted <END>

Fame is like a fire that burns with great intensity. But once it burns itself out, then what? If a man is content with his life, then what more can fame possibly do for him? Can it give him anything more? Nothing. Nothing more than that he may be happy with what he has.

Some men think they can be happy without fame. But it is impossible, for the reason that we are all of us bound by ties of nature, and connected with one another; and that it is natural to love one another. To love a man, therefore, as a man is, is to love a piece of that nature; and this, in respect to the whole, is of the same kind with it that it is itself. Therefore, if thou desirest to be happy, be content with thyself; for this, I tell thee, is the only thing that can bring it to pass; but thou must also be content with others, for this is the way to love them: And now, as for thy desire to be happy, be contented with what thou hast.

For that, which is most noble, and excellent, in itself, is also most excellent and noble, in its actions.

For, as all other virtues are in respect of one another as parts to a whole, and parts are not excellent, unless they are in the whole; so endurance also is not excellent, unless it be in patience and in the bearing of other evils. For to endure, is to bear; and to bear, is to endure. They are one and the same.

As the seeds, that when the time is come, they spring forth, and grow up unto the plants, and to trees. And they die in the fruit and in the seed, and are again born again, out of the seeds.

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is not only to serve his constituents, but to inspire and guide his followers, that they may strive after virtue and wisdom, and in a due and regular manner, execute their respective offices and duties, for the benefit and advantage of the commonwealth. In the execution of their duty, a leader may be obliged to use force and violence; but the use of such, must be accompanied with equity and justice, and according to that law of nature which is written in every man's heart; and which is the same for every one, and the same for every particular man. For this law is written in every man's heart, and it is that which is common to all rational and reasonable men; and that which is written in the laws of nature, and the laws of all rational and reasonable men.
To be a true and faithful leader, is to be a true and faithful teacher: and to teach is a part of a leader's duty. The best leaders are those who teach best: and therefore it is, that of all other duties and offices, teaching is the most honourable, and the most advantageous.

It is evident that, in such matters, as the nature of things is such, that they cannot be done, or be known, but by the help of some divine revelation; and so they must be believed to be done, and known, without any further proof.
Now, as this question of the true interpretation of the scriptures is the matter in dispute between the Hebrews and the Gentiles; the Jew, who would not believe, or not give credit to the Gentiles, and to the heathen, if they did believe them: he will have the interpretation from the priest and the elders of the synagogue, and so will he hold the truth of the scriptures, as it hath been taught unto them by their fathers, and is the tradition of their fathers, that the heavens and the earth were created, and that Adam was created, and that Noah built the ark, and that the flood came, and that all the rest is a story, of a people which was destroyed.

That there are those who do not obey; that some do obey, and yet not obey the same; that there is difference of opinion; and that some, as to their opinions, are in a manner the same, and yet differ as to their practice, are all things, which men of such a mind and disposition, as those that are wont to be in such a manner, do always observe. For when a man doth see a great multitude of such a kind, it doth give him a good notion of that, of which they are themselves; and it doth show him, that it doth much belong to such men, that they do not all do the same thing. For even among the multitude, there doth appear some who do not obey, and others who do. But in any particular case, where a man doth obey, it doth show him, that they do not all do the same. For if they had all done the same, it should not be particular. But when any one doth do the contrary, it doth show, that they do not all do the same; for they all do not agree in this.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
Fame is like a fleeting shadow. It can change in a moment, and vanish as easily. To be content and at peace, it is necessary for one to look upon fame, as on a thing of no worth. Let one be as content and at peace, as if he had never known any other than a simple peasant; and the rest of the world shall be as they are, content and at peace.

For what is it that thou dost strive after? is it riches? and what are riches? nothing, but a thing that doth wear away, like sand, and doth vanish, like smoke. What is it that thou doest strive after? is it power? and what is power? nothing but the power that the earth doth give to all men. What is it that thou dost strive after? is it honour? and what is honour? nothing, but a thing of fleeting nature, like the honour of a dead man. What is it that thou doest strive after? is it pleasure? and what is pleasure? nothing but a thing that doth wear away, like sand, and doth vanish, like smoke.

<BEGIN> On finding peace and happiness.

How happy and serene must it be, that finds true peace and happiness! For all those that are not happy, cannot but wish that they were so, but are kept by their passions and miseries to a perpetual distraction and torment. They are a kind of miserable and troubled spirits. And their lives are but a long series of distractions, and tumults.

How happy is that, which doth possess itself with true peace and happiness! For that is a treasure, beyond measure. It is a happy life, which is free from all kinds of passions, and troubles.

And in the world, what is there, that can hinder and prevent that happiness, and peace? But a few, who do but seek it. And in this life, that is the chief part of happiness and peace.

To seek it, is the same as to possess it. For when it is sought for, it is possessed.

And now, I would have you to consider, and ponder, that the happiness, which we speak of, is not only a temporary happiness, but a perpetual happiness. And in the world, there is nothing, but a few, who do seek after it. And in the life, of this world, there is nothing, but a few, <END>

The passage of time is a perpetual subject of discourse, both with philosophers, poets, and other men. As it is a matter of great difficulty, of which all men are agreed, and yet no man is fully persuaded; so the nature of the world is one of those things, of which it is impossible to have a proper understanding; for that is not knowledge, that only gives an apprehension of things; but true knowledge is that which is common to all; and is found only by reason: and it is a thing most wonderful, and admirable. How many men and women in our city have not yet passed threescore years; how many have died of natural death? The passage of time is the proper subject of meditation for them. But to those who live not long after, the passage of time, the nature of the world, is an insignificant matter. They should meditate upon things, which, for their time, are the things of men.

Some call it the virtue of discretion, and the virtue of judgment. But that which is truly the virtue of discretion, is that which is truly just, and truly good, and that is not merely in the discretion of the man, but in the very nature and substance of the thing.
For to have judgment and to have discretion, is not the same thing. Judgment is that which is of reason, and of discretion is that which is of prudence and of good-will. And prudence is that which is of understanding and of good-will.
For prudence is the truest and most noble of all virtues; and of all others the most necessary.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger (Aphorisms).
Deal with thyself, and thyself alone. Anger is but a mind-fulness of being grieved; and that is a grief which can never be cured, without thy own good-will, to be rid of it. Yet is there no need to be angry, when thou shalt take care to be neither grieved nor angry.

It is good for any man that he should have a care of his own mind; as for the matter of his life and affairs, to seek after a good reputation and a good conscience. It is also good for the same, that he should have a care of his own body.

But now of anger. As it is very grievous to the mind, so also to the body. It doth cause the eyes to burn with inflammation; and the blood to boil with inflammation, and also the brain. Wherefore it is fit for any man to be angry, if so be he shall not be angry.

This is a true saying: If thou art angry, be not angry. If thou art grieved, be not grieved. If thou art afraid, be not afraid.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless to a truly fulfilled life.

By the way, what a wonderful and perfect day we had!

This is just the beginning of the same day.

We went on, and soon reached a little pond of water; and as we sat down at our ease, I could not help but wonder in myself, how such a little thing could be so much admired and loved by the world. And now as I sit here and look upon that same pond, I can see it to be as beautiful as it is, but it is not beautiful for its beauty sake.

To understand why I say this, consider that a man, who was once an honest and good man, may have fallen from that good and honest state; and so his beauty, as it was, hath faded, and been covered. And in like manner, a man, that was once truly happy, may have fallen from that true happiness; and so his beauty, as it is, hath faded, and been covered.

Or again, consider a man, who was once a good man, and a good citizen. But now that man, is become a very wicked man; and so his beauty, as it is, hath faded, and been covered.

And now, let us look upon that pond. And behold! <END>

Of the nature of true religion, and its proper end. - True religion is nothing else than the true worship and service of God. It is the true understanding and belief of the mysteries and dispensations of God; and it is the constant observing and doing of those things which God commands.
Of the power and majesty of God. - God is the maker and author of all things, and the ruler of all that existeth; and He is infinite, eternal, and unchangeable. He is the very same yesterday, today, and forever. He is the only and true God, and He is not like unto any other.
Of the vanity of the world. - All that is in the world is either a creature, or a thing, or a state; but these are all things, and creatures, and states, which are nothing: for they are either nothing at all, or they are not so much as things.

Whoever has not lived his life well, has not lived at all; for one has not lived, unless he have had the use and enjoyment of that life, with all the power and faculty, which God has granted unto him. If the end of man be, to be happy for ever, it is true and good, as a matter of faith. For he that is happy for ever, must have lived well, and well, he that doth not live well. If therefore our lives be to be happy for ever, then is it not the duty of every man, to live well? As for the age and the quality of life; for every one is old, that has not been young, and every one old, that hath not lived well. If all men should be young, and all men happy, it is not possible; but all men happy, it is possible, but not all young. For one thing is young, that is not yet old, another, that is yet old. To be old, is not the same thing with to be happy. The happy is, that which is according to his nature: the old is that, which is according to his years.

When the body has suffered many hardships and is weak, and many people, according to the circumstances of their condition, must be kept back from those who are already dead, and the spirits of the dead must be held in check: and in such manner must be restrained, that their souls should not be disturbed by the clamors and loud noise, of the people who are grieved for them, and for the calamity that befell the dead. For in those places, as the bodies of the dead do rest, they have no occasion to grieve for those bodies: and in those places, as the bodies of the dead do rest, they have no occasion to grieve for themselves; but their own spirits, are much more properly concerned, for that their souls should be at peace, than for the bodies of men; because their souls and spirits are more properly their own, than their bodies and flesh. Now let it be considered, and be taken to heart: that there are some spirits, that do not even need their bodies.

Many men of noble birth, and of great wealth, who have lived for many years, and yet, are not one day the wiser, as they suppose; neither do they think one day the more to be spent on the world, and the things of the world; but rather, they spend it all up, in one day. Many men of great honour, and great riches, who have died in their hundredth year; that are, however, not much wiser, as they are supposed. What is the matter of it then?

For when anger is raged in the heart, it doth cut off and destroy all comfort: and that is the cause of all calamities, and troubles, and vexations. Thus then must thou endure patiently the blows and buffets. And if thou canst not, pray. And then let the wind do its will; and let it be as it will: and fear not; for fear doth but increase anger. Thus must thou patiently endure, until it be gone: and then shalt thou be at rest again. And remember, when anger is gone, thou shalt be able to do anything: and then, take thy rest.

Learn then, to think, and not merely to speak; to discourse, and not only to speak; and so on, through the whole chain of faculties. For this, thou must first get a good understanding of the parts of the mind, and then the whole: for they are not in a constant state of motion, but in a perpetual motion, of growth and decay. To speak and think, are two different things: to think, is a kind of reasoning and judgment: and so it is, also, to read and to write. For what doth the mind intend, in all that it doth? To attain knowledge, that she may the better know herself, and the things of this world. Now, to attain knowledge, is the utmost of all. And therefore, that all things be done by reason and understanding, is the only true way, that by which a man can attain unto all knowledge.

<BEGIN> On the behavior of others. It is certain, that those that are wise and just, have the best sense; and are least likely to err, or do wrong. And that which is good, is that which doth well agree with reason. This reason, as is commonly said, is of men, or angels, who in their
judicement and consideration, are governed by their own good will and good nature, that is, their own common goodness. This common goodness is the foundation of the whole universe; and of that which is good and fair.

The whole world is governed, as is commonly said, by an invisible hand; that is, by the hand of the supreme
governor, as is commonly said; and by that which is just and reasonable in itself, according to the common sense and understanding of mankind.

Therefore, every man should seek after that which is just and reasonable; and that which is good and fair in itself; and should use his own natural and proper faculties for the better understanding, and managing of those things, which are good and fair. And to understand those things which are good and fair, is nothing more than to follow the common sense and understanding of mankind.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless

Fame is often considered a measure of success, and many people strive to become famous for their achievements, whether in art, music, literature, or other fields. However, fame is ultimately meaningless, and it does not bring happiness, satisfaction, or fulfillment.

There are several reasons why fame is meaningless:

1. **Fame is fleeting**: Fame is a transitory state, and it can disappear as quickly as it appeared. Once a famous person's career has peaked, their reputation may begin to decline, and they may find themselves no longer relevant or sought after.
2. **Fame is not a source of happiness**: Many famous people report feeling unfulfilled and unhappy, despite their outward success. This is because fame can be isolating and alienating, and it can also be accompanied by intense pressure and scrutiny.
3. **Fame can be a curse**: Fame can be a double-edged sword, bringing both benefits and drawbacks. For example, a famous person may be subjected to intense media scrutiny and public criticism, which can be damaging to their mental health and well-being.
4. **Fame does not bring fulfillment**: Despite being famous, some people may feel that they are not truly fulfilled or satisfied with their lives. This can be because they <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace: the words of a Christian
The most perfect and happy man of all men, is he who is at peace with God, and in his own mind. As the body without its soul cannot be said to be living, so without the soul, or with the soul not at peace, cannot the body be said to be happy. He is not happy, who has not peace in his own mind, but is troubled with the affections and passions. His body is not happy, because his mind is not happy: his mind is not happy, because his body is not happy; and he is not happy, because he is not happy. (St. Augustine.) Now, peace of mind is peace of the soul; and peace of the soul, peace of body.
(St. Basil.): They who have peace in their own minds, and in their hearts, they have a peace that passeth all understanding. They are happy, that they may be happy, that they may be at peace, that they may not be troubled. They are happy, that they may not be miserable, and that they may not be grieved. They are happy, that they may not be angry, and that they may not be offended.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence. By John Wase, D.D.

t is a thing of great difficulty to understand, that silence, as such, is not an evil; for that it may be, in some respects, good, is evident. For all things, whatsoever they be, which are done or spoken, they are either evil or good. And as for speaking, that is either to do evil, or to do good. And if that be said of speaking, which is only, and proper, and natural; to that the same thing is true of silence. For if a man speaketh, either evil or good, then he speaketh only, or only naturally: if he keepeth his silence, then is he either evil, or good. If the good, then is his silence, also only, or only natural. If he speak, only or naturally, then must he be only, or only naturally; and if he keepeth silence, only, or naturally, then must he only, or only naturally be.

If thou dost understand this, then thou must see, that silence, as such, is not an evil. But that which is silent, is evil. For, as I have said, if a man be evil, he doth speak, either only <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain and suffering is not the mark of a true saint. St. Paul's experience in his prison is the true and genuine model of patience and endurance, not of any, but of a true saint.

-St. Augustine

Endurance is the proper attribute of saints; that which they suffer patiently for the truth of the gospel. There is no pain and suffering, but it is for the glory of God; and that alone is that true happiness.

-St. Augustine

Endurance of pain and suffering, or patience, is a true and proper part of the heavenly life. They that are in the world are also partakers of this, but in a lesser degree, and with many interruptions, until the full redemption of their souls.

-St. Irenaeus

It is not the pain itself, but the endurance of the pain, that doth make the soul to be holy, and to be a saint; because pain is the proper instrument of all punishment; and of all that is offensive and hateful.

-St. Chrysostom

But what is it that is offensive and hateful? Is it not sin? For this is that which doth offend both the conscience of a man, and the eye of an angel; and it is this alone that can make the soul <END>

Concerning the generation, the preservation, and the decay of things. Part the second.
Part the first. Of a man; that is to say, of himselfe. To be a man, and to be a Christian, is one thing, and to be a man and a Christian, is another. As there are things of a common nature, so are there things that are of a common grace. Things, that are common to all men, but not to every particular man.
A common grace, is that grace, that is common to all, that is to say, that is common to all men of a common nature; and that is, the grace of life itself. But that grace of life, that is common to all men, is, that which is common to the whole body of the world, but not to every particular man. The grace of life, that is common to the whole body of the world, is, the grace of grace itself, that is, the grace of grace itself.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger, patience is the remedy.
Patience is a balm unto all those that are troubled or offended, as well as unto themselves themselves. Patience is a healing medicine to all passions and hurtful humors. A patience of mind, that is temperate and orderly, is a remedy against all the various humours and affections of the mind.
Patience, temperance, and modesty, which are the three chief virtues, will never do any harm.
Patience is that which is able to soothe the wrath, to temper the heat, and to moderate the unreasonableness of the mind. The more a man is pleased with patience, the more he will be able to soothe the wrath and unreasonableness of others.
Patience, therefore, is a medicine and a balm against all passions, and against all hurtful humours, and against all unreasonableness of the mind. Let us then, by patience and temperance, strive to avoid all evil, and to follow all good and holy things. For without patience, we shall not be able to endure the things that are bad, nor to bear with the things that are bad. For patience is the remedy, not only against evil, but also against evil and against <END>

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe. For to what end then were all those things created, if they shall be destroyed, and all things pass away? For a good end, that is, that we may have good minds, good actions, and good lives; which are not to be destroyed, and which are of those things which are eternal; but not of those things which are temporal; which are subject to dissolution, and pass away; and for the destruction of those things which are not of eternal nature. The things that are of eternal nature are those that are of a celestial. And the things that are of a celestial, are those that are of a divine nature.
And I say unto thee, O foolish man, that the things which are not of a celestial nature, and the things that are not of a divine nature, are not subject to the destruction of eternal things. For those things which are not subject to the destruction of eternal things, are the things that are not of a celestial nature; and those things that are of a celestial nature, are of a divine nature.
And thus thou shalt have one universal nature of the universe, and one eternal and celestial nature, and one divine nature. For all the things that are in the universe, are subject to the common nature and the common principle <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death? with patience and cheerfulness, as one that hath lived well and in a good disposition.

A very good way to deal with death, is to consider, how soon the season will come, to each of us; and how soon, after that, death will be brought home unto our souls. This makes death, not so terrible, as it doth seem to many. For, if thou canst bear the thought of death, so that it seemeth not to be so bad a matter, it will also follow, that when the time cometh, thou shalt not be so disturbed, or moved by grief, as many are.

When thou thinkest upon thyself, how soon thou shalt die, thou must also think, that thou shalt die as a good Christian, and as a good man. Thou shalt die, as one that hath lived in a good disposition, and as one that hath served the Lord in all his time.

A man that is well pleased, and happy with his lot, shall always be cheerful, and full of cheerfulness. A man, that is vexed and discontented, shall be always ill-natured, and ill-tempered.

The death of the just and righteous is like unto a seed which is sown, <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is not only to carry the weight of the government, but to promote and foster all the arts, sciences and trades which are necessary and proper to the commonwealth and to the public happiness; and, above all, the sacred duty of defending and maintaining the truth. (James Harrington, Political Reflexions)
The most important thing in life is to learn how much ought to be given for a good thing, and to know what to accept and what to reject; that is, to know, in general, how much and how little to give and receive. For when anything is proposed to thee, consider the use of the thing, the matter and substance of it; and if the substance be good, and the use to thee, accept and give thy consent; and if the substance be bad, or the use to thee not proper, refuse and disapprove. (Henry More)
The main question is, what shall be the nature of a good commonwealth, and what of a bad one? What shall be the nature of a good man, and what of a bad man? What shall be the nature of a good city, and what of a bad city?... The end and object of all government is to keep all men in the right; but to keep them all <END>

<BEGIN> On logic and reason.
That men have reason. We may see the same from the observations of the world. We see that, according to reason and wisdom, man doth always endeavour, as far as he can, to avoid pain and to attain pleasure. The earth also doth so, in its own nature and proper ways: to avoid pain, and to seek pleasure.
Hence, it may be inferred, that both man, and the earth, and all the world, are endowed with a natural faculty and disposition. whereby they are disposed, to act, and to move, according to their own nature and proper ways.
This natural faculty, is nothing else but reason: by which they are disposed, and able to act, and to move, according to their own proper ways, and according to the reason of their natural nature.
And here is to be noted, that, whatever else men may be, reason is natural to them: that is, that which is natural to man. The earth also is not natural, but rather artificial; or rather artificial and manufactured. For, it is artificial, as it were, according to the work of the Creator: and according to the nature, and disposition of its own proper constitution; and according to the nature, and disposition of the mind <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless to me. Fame is an unquenchable flame, which burns very fiercely, and consumes, and destroys many souls. I must therefore not be affected with it. To be free from the effects of fame, is a thing both of great dignity and of great difficulty. If I have the power, I will endeavour to be free from the effects of fame. To be free, is to live and to die. To die, is to die a good death, and not to suffer, but to come to my end in a state of tranquillity; to die in a state of peace, with the remembrance of my sins, but not with any sorrow or discontent, and not as if any body were displeased or grieved. For to die, is to be well pleased with the state of my affairs; to die in the state of peace, is to die a good death. I am now at rest, I am contented. I am not ashamed to die. I am not afraid. I do not expect anything that may happen hereafter. I do not fear any thing that I do not fear already. I do not think any thing that I do not already think. I do not believe anything that I do not already believe. I do not <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace
When one is out of breath and exhausted, and all his passions are spent, then is there nothing more in the world to be desired, as for those things that are pleasant unto us, we must have patience and constancy, and not be easily disquieted or moved. For it is a thing most foul and wicked to be easily moved and disturbed. As for those things that are hateful unto us, it is a thing most commendable and laudable, that they are easily gotten rid of. As for those things that are either hard or easy, or both, we must not be in a hurry, or hasty in any thing, but must be slow and gentle, and considerate of every thing, and take heed of the time and season, that it is a thing that can be done. For to be slow and gentle, and to consider of the time, is a thing that is most pleasant and agreeable unto man. And therefore it is, that in many matters, there is a kind of dispute and strife, and contention between them that are slow and gentle, and them that are hasty and impetuous, and swift in all things. For to be slow and gentle, is a thing that is not apt for haste, and <END>

By way of meditation, let us consider, wherof our life and action are composed; that is, wherof all our understanding and knowledge doth consist, and that by the assistance of which we do understand, what is right and what is wrong: That is, wherof our reason doth partake; and withal, what is the nature and constitution of this rational part of us: and how that very nature, and constitution, which is part of us, is subject to decay and corruption, and doth continually change and mutate.
Of the nature and constitution of that rational part of us, which doth partake of our reason; and of the change and mutation of it, there is a true meditation. How that very nature and constitution, which doth partake of our reason, and of our understanding, and of our knowledge, and of all these things, doth continually change, and doth mutate; and that even of its own self.

     What is there in the world, that is not a subject of some sort of silence? As in the world, there is nothing so foolish or unreasonable as that which is called silence.
     Now, to make haste to that, which I have already begun, I have only to say, that silence, though it is called silence, is yet not so. For what is called silence, is but the silence of the mind, that is to say, a silent heart.
     And to that, I must add, that many men, who are in a quiet and retired life, yet are not so quiet, and retired, as to be worthy of their own quietness and retirement. For many men, are more busy than their work, in some sort doth deserve their quietness and retirement; and therefore, to be in a quiet and retired life, is not only a thing of ease, but a thing also of necessity. For all men must be in some sort or other, a quiet and retired life. For as in the world, there is nothing so unreasonable, and <END>

How couldst thou not find comfort, when thou art so well equipped with all the tools of pain, and with the power of nature to overcome all affliction? For it is a great comfort to find a remedy in the very thing that causes pain.
For he that is skilled in the art of medicine, hath many remedies for pains, but few remedies for the passions, and especially for pride. Yet for pride, there is a remedy which is most excellent, and that is a sense of the worthlessness of things, and of the small part thou dost play in all. For if thou dost consider and take heed of that, thou shalt have an end of pride, and of all pride. But if thou dost not consider and take heed of that, thou shalt not be rid of pride and of all pride.
In a word, if thou wilt always put off pain, and trouble, and affliction, and ever put them off, thou shalt never have anything to do with them, but to put them off. For this is their nature; to be put off, and to be gone. Therefore, thou shalt not find any comfort or <END>

Some of his notable works are Meditation XVII, Upon a Flea, The Sun Rising, Holy Sonnet 10. It is one of those poems that, if it were put in one line, it could not be understood. The whole is as it was, a meditation, which is an exercise of the mind and imagination, not a recital or relation of some external, and ordinary, and common things, and actions.

For in it, there is a true, a proper, or natural light: which is, the understanding: and the light of understanding, is only a light, that doth exist and doth work, only so far as it is a true light and a proper light; but in its common way, it is a false light, or a dim light. For what light can it have, in such a way, but this, that it is only a faint and weak light, and it doth only serve to enlighten, and not properly to enlighten the eyes of a man, but to enlighten only the understanding; that is, it doth not properly enlighten the eyes of the understanding. For it is not the understanding, which is a part of the universe, that doth properly see it, but it is only the body, and it is but the parts of the body.

In the government of a republic, the duty of a good magistrate is, first to see the mind of a man is not corrupted. If his mind is corrupted, then he ought to endeavour, to restore it to its right original condition, which was never corrupted, that is to say, to its natural innocence.
It is better for a man to be of a simple mind and to have an honest disposition, than to be a man of cunning and wile. A man of honesty is in general of good credit with all men, and a man of honesty is, as it were, the image of virtue.

That which is the highest that a man can be, is not a fame of the world.... I will not be a man that hath not a sense of what is to be done in the world; and I will not be a man that is altogether useless in it. To be in the world, and not to have a power to do any good there, is nothing, but an impotency, an infirmity. But to have a power there, is a good and a happy thing.

The whole world is full of noise and confusion, but in the heart, there is a profound silence and a perfect calmness, and that is the true perfection of the soul.

The former is to bear things, in any particular case, that do seem unto thee to be grievous or tedious; but to bear them, not with the intention that they should be grievous or tedious, but with a proper respect unto those things that are proper unto them. The latter is to seek for pleasures, in such sort that they may not be such things, as in themselves are hateful or repugnant to nature.

Of all things that are either naturally or artificially created, it must be the shortest of all that is naturally created.
The world is of itself eternal; and as the eternal is not at all limited by its duration, so neither is the world either limited by its duration, or affected by the passing of any particular duration, in respect of its being eternal. It is not an eternal as it respects the eternal, nor yet is it not eternal, as it respects the eternal: but as it respects the eternal, it is eternal, and as it respects the eternal, it is eternal.
The world, therefore, is in a perpetual motion of eternity; as that eternal which is of itself, is not in any particular motion or duration: neither doth any particular motion of eternity affect the eternal which is of itself. But as that eternal which is of itself, is eternal, and that eternal which is of itself, is of itself eternal; so is it with that eternal which is of itself, that it is of itself eternal, and that eternal which is of itself, eternal.

And though we do but now speak of the knowledge, or understanding, that is, how to discern, and how to understand; yet truly, what to believe is also a kind of understanding.

SOME men in time of war, not only for their own safety, but also for their credit and honour, take pains to keep their private affairs and transactions from public notice.

Such of these as do it out of fear or a desire of avoiding the noise and tumult, are truly fools: for fear and a desire of avoiding the noise and tumult, is no less reasonable for them, than it was for those that fought for their honour, to fear of the pain and danger of the sword: for the one was to fight for their honour, and the other for their safety; and both, are to be done for one and the other.

The other, that do it, out of a desire of credit and honour, are also true fools: for what is the honour and credit of a man, but for his own virtue and goodness? For in the end of all things, they that are most virtuous, shall have most credit and honour; but they that are most virtuous in their actions and affairs, shall have least noise and tumult.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless and you can live happily ever after without it.

You will not be able to tell that you have lived, unless you know the causes that have led you to be here. These causes, the object of our discourse, are, first, that we may be happy; and secondly, that we may be virtuous. And here it is to be observed, that what is commonly called happiness is not always happiness. There are two kinds of happiness.

The first kind of happiness, and the true happiness of a man, is such happiness, and such content, and such delight, which, in this world, are only those things which can be found by the senses, or by the mind, without any external assistance, such happiness therefore as is the common happiness, and the natural happiness, which is the happiness of a man, without any external assistance.

The second kind of happiness, and the false happiness, is such happiness, and such content, and such delight, which are the effects of the senses, and of the body; such happiness, and such content, and such delight, as are obtained by the use of the senses, and by the use of the body; and these are the things, which, in the world, are called the pleasures.

The way, not the thing; the end, not the effect; the substance, not the shadow; the true, not the false; and in short, all things in their own proper place, and manner.

The end of all things is, that they should be set in their proper place; and in such manner, that the one thing in its proper place, and the other, in its proper place, may cohere together. And when the one thing in its proper place, and the other, in its proper place, shall cohere together, that is to say, be united in their nature, then and only is the peace that is spoken of, to be attained.

And in the nature of the thing, to be set in its proper place, we find the thing itself, which is the very essence of the thing.

The thing which is in its proper place, is that thing itself which is in its proper place; and that is the essence, not the shadow, the thing itself.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is the first and most necessary of all virtues. For in all things, and in all actions, silence is the true and perfect end of all things; and the first and principal good of the soul.

— Erasmus

Erasmus, the Dutch poet and humanist, is particularly known for his writings in the classical languages. As the most famous of the Dutch humanists, he wrote extensively in Latin, and his writings, including the Epistles of a Pilgrim and The Praise of Folly, are still widely read and appreciated today. (Full text available online.)

In the text, Erasmus writes about the importance of silence. He suggests that silence is the ultimate goal and good of the soul. Erasmus's words continue to resonate with readers today, who would likely appreciate the timeless wisdom and insights that Erasmus expresses in this short passage.

What do you think? Is Erasmus's statement about the importance of silence one that we can all relate to? What are some examples of times when silence may be a more appropriate or effective choice?

This is a very common occurrence among men: to have their wrath turn to anger, or their anger turn to wrath. But in truth, we do not understand what that is, which is properly called anger. (Cicero, De Oratore, ii. 1. 5.) — For truly to be angry, is properly and simply to have in one's mind a certain displeasing or disliking: to be angry is the same thing as to dislike. And so to be angry, is one and the same thing as to be displeased. (St. Chrysostom, Homily, xxi.) — For to be angry, is to desire a thing, that thou mayest get rid of it. (Bede, Homily, ii. 12.)

In the case of a man, who has been wounded, the physicians prescribe to him a certain quantity of food, and drink.

And that which is according to the nature of the universe, or to the constitution of all things, and what the nature of the universe is, are matters which depend not on the opinion, and the judgement of either, whether a man, or a man of great learning and wisdom.
The universe being the same which is the common nature of the world, and the nature of that which is common to all things in the world, and all the parts of the world, it is also that which is according to nature and common to all things in it; and according to the common constitution or nature of the universe, it is according to nature, or the common nature of all things that are in it. (Aristotle).

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is not to follow the crowd, but to create a new crowd. - Robert Green Inverarity.

What a wonderful and wise thing, to be a leader in thy own life, and in thy community! The common people, and the ignorant and superstitious multitude, should ever look up unto thee, and follow thee.

For there is a dignity in every person that is most worthy and excellent: and it is the office and duty of those who are placed in the highest and most honourable places, to represent and maintain that dignity in the best and most honourable manner.

A true and faithful leader should ever strive and endeavour, not only to preserve and maintain his own dignity, and reputation, and honour, but also that of the society or community, to which he is entrusted.

To be a faithful and obedient subject, and to do thy duty unto the rulers of the realm, is a true and honourable thing: and it is that which the common people and multitude are most apt to do, and to think most proper.

In all worldly affairs, we should ever remember that we are not our own proper rulers and governors; but rather that of God, the true and only ruler and governor of all things.

Aristotle's dogmatic assertion, that a man cannot know any thing, unless he know the cause, is generally received, and even applauded, in the schools of philosophy. But here is the question, how to come to that knowledge. And what is it that is known of the cause, that he may not be in vain. For if one's mind, which is the only place of the mind where they are wont to come to know the causes, is not able, as I have already said, either to perceive any thing, or to understand anything, how can it be, that he that doth know the causes, knoweth what it is, which is to know a thing? And what is it that is known, that one knows a thing? If it be the cause, that is known; but what is the cause? What is known? And so on, for evermore, and in vain.
This is the nature of our ignorance, as I have already said; for we have no power of perceiving any thing, or of understanding anything: and as for the causes, that are of things, they are unknown, and in a manner, unspeakable. For what is the nature of things <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless?
The human mind is naturally inclined towards vanity and self-love. Hence, when a man gets any kind of fame, and reputation in this world, his mind is puffed up and swollen. As a consequence, all his faculties and virtues are obscured by the veil of self-love and pride. And thus, while he is, on the outside, pretending to be a just, a righteous, a good man, on the inside, he is filled with pride and self-love. As a result, he cannot see and understand that all those things, for which he boasts and prates, are of no use and value.
In the same way, when men go about, and glorying in the outward appearance of the world, they are pleased and delighted with those things, which are visible to the world: as, their garments, their riches, their houses, their families, their honours, and their names. And as for those things, which they do not see, or which are hidden from the world; and which are not visible, but by some, which are hidden in their minds and understandings, and which are not to be known, without a divine revelation, they are as nothing, and of no use whatsoever.

This opinion, I may suppose, hath been entertained by all men, from the beginning of the world; and that all men have been equal and indifferent as to the value of money, from that time to this.

But I do not see, how one can say, that anything is said well, or eloquently, which is only expressed in a multitude of words, and with a multitude of figures. For in the way of speaking, it is not the multitude of words, nor the multitude of figures, that is the true beauty and grace of eloquence. Rather let it be the order and the disposition of the words and sentences, which is the true beauty and grace of eloquence; and let the mind, that speaks, be of one that is well ordered, and disposed: and that doth understand, what is said, and how it is said.

And how is it, that the very longest-lived man, is not able, by all the means, and ways that can be, to make himself acquainted with what that is, that he was born for? and to make it his business, to live only to that, which it is, that he was born for?

That which is the matter of this universe, that is, the body of the world, must be either material or immaterial, in such a way, that, whether the body be material or immaterial, or both, the essence of its matter must be one, that is, an intelligible soul or intellect, which is of that kind, that is, such as to make a world; which in itself is immaterial and spiritual. For that which is the matter of this universe, is, as is already said, a body or mass of bodies, so that this body or mass of bodies, being what it is, a mass of bodies, it is in its very essence immaterial, that is, spiritual. This is proved by the following argument: All bodies that have extension, are divisible. And if anything be divisible, it is divisible by something that is not it self. That is, if anything be divisible, it must have a divisor other than itself, that is, it must be divided by an other; and that other, again, must be either a body or a soul.

He must take care not only to keep up his own good opinion of himself, but also the opinion of others, that he be thought worthy, not only for his past performances, but for his present conduct. He must be content to bear such reproaches as be due, and such censure as be just. For this end it is not sufficient, that he should be able to speak well and do well; but he must also be able to endure to hear well and suffer well; and therefore, he must learn to bear with patience and meekness, the injuries of others.

Hereby they shall be well persuaded, that they have not only lived and died, as ordinary men, but, in their own particular way, they have lived as men of great honour, and glory.
The words “as men of great honour, and glory” must be taken in the light of their own particular way of living. Thus the words “as men of great honour, and glory” must be understood, that they did honour themselves, and glory in that particular, as being the peculiar province of their own proper trade: but in general, they did honour the honour of man, and glory in the glory of God; which is the highest and true honour, and glory that can be in any man.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless to those who love truth, and who, like true philosophers, are occupied with the understanding of nature.

THESE few lines, as we have said, may be regarded as a kind of epitaph or memorial, of all the great men who were esteemed philosophers; for their honour and fame doth depend on the knowledge they had, and the true understanding of nature which they possessed.

In the old days, the fame of philosophers was a kind of thing, not to be understood, as to what manner of men they were, who were accounted worthy of that honour, but to be known, as to what things they had believed, or thought. For in the days of old, their writings were not commonly seen: and therefore, to speak of them, was to speak of that which they had thought. In those times, there was no need to have their writings before them, in order to understand them; but the same was true of all other matters, whereof they spoke: and this they did, as it were, out of their memory, or remembrance.

The rest of their time, they occupied themselves with the contemplation of truth, and the understanding of nature. For they were not occupied with such things, as might make them famous in the world; <END>

And again, to be pleased with his own way of life; to be pleased with himself, for he is a good man; for his own mind is content with itself.
If he can find no rest for his soul; if he can find no peace of mind; if he can find no quietness of spirit; then the time of his death is come.
This is the peace of the righteous; this is their quietness, this is their rest. A man that doth love his wife is at rest.
A man that doth love his country, and his parents, and his brethren, and his friends, is at peace.
A man that doth obey God, is at rest.
A man that doth love his neighbors, is at peace.
A man that doth not love his neighbors, is not at peace. But for this there are two kinds of men; one kind that doth love their neighbors; another that doth not love them. For they that do not love their neighbors, do not love their brethren, their kinsfolk, their fellow-citizens; and therefore they are not at peace.

Whose end is but to be a beginning; and whose beginning is but a passing away. The man is he who is not a man, but a moment of time. For what is it, but a fleeting breath, or a moment's breath? (1 Peter ii. 11. ) And who can tell what is the nature of this breath? Can any man tell of what sort is it? or what is the substance of it? Can he know of what kind he is? or in what way of matter he is made?

And of what is a man, made of matter of this sort, that can tell the nature of the matter of his body, and the nature of the breath that is out of him? It is not easy. For he that is out of him, is not himself; and what he is in, is not that he is out of him. The man is he who is not a man, but a moment of time.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence. - "To give a true and just answer unto that question, what is a man that is silent? I would have you consider what it is, that a man should be silent, that is to say, that he should not be loath or afraid to answer unto the questions that are put unto him: or to speak as he is bidden, and to forbear speaking in certain cases: and not to make use of any matter or matter, as though it were fit and necessary that he should speak of it, when indeed he might forbear and be silent: as it was said already, that a man, that doth speak of such things, doth not speak as he is bidden: and doth speak, that is to say, he doth speak without being bidden. And if thou wilt consider, what a man doth, that is silent, and what he doth, that is silent, and how it doth befall unto him, that doth speak of such things, thou shalt see, that they are but as it were a natural course or course of nature: and not anything that doth exceed the natural course of nature.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain: A critical review of the concept
The endurance of pain refers to the ability of the human body to withstand prolonged and repetitive exposure to noxious stimuli. The literature suggests that endurance of pain is a multifaceted construct, influenced by various psychological, physiological, and neurobiological factors. This critical review aims to synthesize the current understanding of endurance of pain, identifying its conceptual and theoretical underpinnings, as well as its empirical validation and limitations. The findings suggest that endurance of pain is a complex phenomenon that cannot be fully explained by individual-level factors, but rather by the interaction of multiple factors at both the individual and societal levels. The review highlights the need for a more comprehensive understanding of endurance of pain, considering the interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors. This review aims to provide a critical analysis of endurance of pain, and to identify avenues for future research. It also aims to provide a framework for understanding this complex phenomenon, and to highlight the need for a more nuanced approach to the study of pain. Overall, this review suggests that endurance of pain is a multifaceted concept, that cannot be fully explained by individual-level factors, and that requires a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of its underlying causes and consequences.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger
The person who is angry is not angry because he is angry, but because there is a cause to anger; and the cause of his anger is his own fault or some other’s fault. But when he sees himself to be angry, he ought not to think any longer for himself. For so much is he deceived, that he cannot know what is the real cause of his anger, but as one that is altogether deceived, and ignorant of himself. He must therefore set his heart on his way. Let him therefore say, Forgive, I will not; I will not forgive; I will not bear it. Let him not say, I will forgive, I will bear it; for forgiveness and bearing is the same thing as agreeing, and consent. Forgive, I will not; I will not bear it. Let him not say, I forgive, I will bear it; for forgiveness and bearing is the same thing as agreeing, and consent.

When he is angry, he ought to be quiet; for in his anger he is not able to speak with any one, nor to think of anything that is to come; but only of the thing that grieves him. For a man who is angry is not able to speak, and he is not able to <END>

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe, it was sufficient, not merely that a true, rational, and living substance did exist in it, but that, this substance being true, rational, and living, it was necessary that it should exist. As a living, rational, and true substance, it is necessary, that it should exist; and so it is with all things in the universe. The only difference is this, that there are some things that, not merely, they do exist; but, that their existence, being necessary, must be either as being one or two, or as being three and four, and the like, or as being a single whole, or as being a part of the whole. For that which is necessary, as it must exist, must so exist, that it must exist. Now that which must exist, must so exist, that it must exist one, or two, or three, or more. And thus they are all as one and the same thing. (De Motu Universalis, Bk. ii, 7)

<BEGIN> How to face death in a brave man, is not an action to be spoken of with the tongue, but done. To tell a man that death is the end, is but the way; to teach a man not to fear death, is the proper way. For if thou canst not, by any means, make death appear to the man, which is the true end of all things, but as an old age; so must he not fear death, that is to say, that it is not death; and yet that it is the true end of all things.
How to die a good man, is a thing of great difficulty: and so is how to live a good man. For this life also, is not easy. But of this we have already spoken: to die well, and to live well, are two things that are not much different.
How to live well, is not much to do. It is enough to desire it; and to live, and die, as is become to a man, that is, as is become to a man of his time; to bear his body, that is to say, his health, well; to bear his mind, that is to say, his will, well; and to bear himself, that is to say, <END>

He must be able to inspire with his presence, with his words, and with his actions. He must be able to inspire with the love and affection of those under his command.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless, and how you can break free from its curse. | By Dr. Joe Dispenza

Fame, power, wealth, and prestige. They're all empty words that don't hold much value when you take away the sense of fulfillment and purpose. They're empty calories. They fill your belly, but they don't nourish your soul. They're hollow, and they're meaningless.

And here's the thing about fame. It's not what it seems. It's not about being a celebrity or a rockstar. It's not about being a famous doctor or a famous scientist. It's about being recognized and respected by your peers. It's about making a meaningful contribution to your field.

And that's it. That's the only thing that truly matters. Your contribution to your field. Not the fame. Not the recognition. Not the accolades. But what you do with your time. How you use your talents and your resources. How you make a positive impact on the world.

And if you can't even be bothered to think about that, then what's the point? I mean, it's not like you're going to end up being remembered as a great scientist. Or a great artist. Or a great writer. No, the point is <END>

To the self-mind, all things that happen in this world, are as mere fantasies, or mere dreams of the world. For as soon as a man hath his mind well occupied with the things of this world, that is to say, with his understanding, his reason, or his imagination, he is free from all fear, and all disturbance: and he is well pleased with the order and constitution of this world, and of all those things that do happen and occur here. But, if he be otherwise occupied, as I have said, then he is troubled with a thousand fears and anxieties; and he is never able to find peace and quietness in himself. And now, as I have said, I will cease. (Heresy.)

Silence is an excellent thing in itself, but to attain unto true silence, thou must first cleanse thyself of all unprofitable thoughts, and of all those things which either are superfluous, or contrary unto the truth.

To a silent mind, thou canst be as the world itself; yet be not thou as the world, in its folly.

Silence is a noble virtue. Yet the word itself is in many places most improperly applied.

The world is governed by the spirit of silence. As the world is governed by the spirit of nature, so it is also by the spirit of silence. For it is the silence of nature that produces her operations, and it is the silence of grace that produces those operations which are spiritual.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain and suffering, and the patience of a Christian.
This is the true meaning of patience. It is not that thou shalt be able to endure any pain or sufferings, or that thou shalt be patient of any affronts or injuries. For that is not true patience, but a weak and false meekness. But the true patience of a Christian is, that thou canst bear patiently the pains of thy own body, and the pains and sufferings that thou art in. And that thou canst also bear patiently the affronts and injuries of men, and the temptations of the devil. As long as thou art able, and it please thee, bear patiently and patiently suffer. This is the true nature and character of a Christian. For what is a Christian, but one who is a sufferer. And what is suffering, but the cross of Christ?
For, as it is written, He that is able to save both his own soul and the souls of men, is he who suffers himself. And the true glory of the cross, is this, that in the suffering of Christ, is the salvation of the whole world. And if the whole world is to be saved by the blood of Christ, that the blood of Christ may also be able to <END>

This he did with great earnestness and zeal, but yet not with sufficient care; for he did not think the nature and condition of the world, as well as the state of that man's affairs, required him to be so circumspect and accurate in his words. Accordingly, when he had said all that he was able to do, and had endeavoured to bring back the man to his reason; and though he could not persuade him to the contrary, he did not now cease: and yet, how soon was he found to be ashamed of the words and expressions, which, at another time, he had been so bold in to use! In a little while, this man and he had a great argument; but yet, though the subject were great, and of much importance; yet the manner, in which the man dealt, and the words which he used, did not give him the grace or the honour that he had the right to; and yet, though it had been his own fault, yet he was not able to bring himself to repent it, and to make amends <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger, it is most reasonable to apply a wholesome moderation unto thyself; that thou mayest not be angry when thou art vexed, neither be angry when thou art not vexed, as I have said. For as a man, by means of some particular thing, is made to be angry; so is he, by some other particular thing, made to be moderate: as of the same kind is a man made angry by a slight; and a man made moderate by a great deal: But neither of these things, when they do happen, are they of such a nature, as to hinder or stay the effect of the other.

From the beginning, that is to say from the very first of the days of our common earth; it is impossible but that men should have had a multitude of inventions: either of devices, or instruments, or tools; either of words, or things written, or written signs: Or else what can it be but a multitude of foolish and idle fancies, and an infinity of nonsense and nothingness?

of which we are, as one particular part of a great multitude; or how that which is done, or which is true, in any part of the world, may either have been done, or be true; or in short, whether anything is possible or impossible.

That which is done, and that which is true, cannot but be done and true, in some part of the world, either of that one, or of that many, or of both. For one either must do it, or there must be some other, which doth it.

Thus in particular: of one city, it may be said, that one man hath done it; of another, that a woman hath done it; and of another, that a child hath done it. But of the same action, by one city, by another, by another, and so on, it can be said that of that multitude, and not of one alone, it is done.

For in truth, that which is true of one, and of one only, is not the same, which is true of another, and of that only; for of the one is not true, and of the other is true. Of one, is not, that that which is, is, that is that <END>

Every living being dies, and every dying being must face death. So we are all equally condemned to death. What we must do therefore, is to have an understanding and a respect for it, and to be ready and prepared to die, as soon as it shall be the Lord’s will. One reason why our minds are so full of pride and conceit, is because they are so well pleased and satisfied with themselves: and so it is that when one is dying, the most of them are troubled and amazed: But if one be satisfied and contented, and if one be at ease: then there is not any more trouble. When one is in the presence of death, one must put away all pride, and conceit: and must put on all humility and modesty; and so he must put away the fear of death and the love of life. Hereafter he must begin to remember that life is but a vapour, and death a sleep. For it is in the sleep of death, that every living being is to be restored. What is that sleep?

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is not to follow the crowd, but to be able to lead. And one of the greatest ways to be a leader, and to lead, is to follow. Not the crowd, but the inspiration of your own heart and conscience, that which guides and directs you to act righteously, and do what is truly just and righteous.
It is the way of the unrighteous, to do the works of the wicked and wicked men, and to follow after their examples; but the righteous, to do the works of righteousness, and to follow after the examples of righteous men.
So to do, and to follow, is one and the same thing. If the way and manner of a man's life be righteous, it will follow that all his actions are righteous; but if the way and manner of his life be wicked, all his actions will also be wicked.
What is required from a man is not his own power, but the power of the Almighty; not his own understanding, but the understanding of the Lord. And what is it that a man doth require for the proper understanding of the Lord? That he doth truly seek and love his will; that he doth truly keep and keep close his heart.

There are two ways of proceeding. One is by reason, and the other by opinion.

The mind is all, and all the mind. But it is not to be supposed, that any particular man doth consist only of this faculty of reasoning and believing. Nay, and if any one man did, it would be very unreasonable that any other man should. But the general and common nature of men, it doth include many things more besides; as the passions of men, and the passions of beasts, and their wills, and desires, and appetites; and all other things which are of use to man, as the senses of man, and man's understanding and judgment.

And to this, add the common opinion of men: that all men are, by nature, the same, and that there is but one natural religion.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless

By John Stuart Mill

In the present day, one is astonished at the notion of some of the people of this generation, that fame, or that their reputation, is of the highest consequence in this life. But a short time ago, it would have been thought a very strange and absurd notion; to suppose that fame had any thing to do with our happiness or comfort. One would have thought it a matter of common sense, that the highest happiness and well-being, of human creatures, can hardly fail to consist in their own happiness and well-being; and that their happiness, therefore, could be as nothing to that of others, or as that of any other individual of the same species.

The object, that is to say, of man's life is the happiness and well-being. If we suppose, therefore, that all the other considerations are excluded, that is to say, all the relations to one another of man, as man, and all the pleasures, pains, and difficulties that attend them, there is one thing which, as such, and as such alone, ought to be considered and cherished as a matter of importance. That thing is the happiness and well-being of each man.

in a troubled world;
that doth seem unto me
to be the only true peace that any man
can attain unto. To attain unto this peace,
he must first of all learn to set aside all worldly care,
and worldly vanity, and all those things which doth disturb
and distract him, and take up his thoughts
with the contemplation
of that divine peace that is in heaven. Forsooth, the Lord himself
is not pleased to hear any man pray unto him,
or to seek of him any assistance or relief;
but that man, who doth seek of him the peace of mind, and the quietness of spirit, is he that doth please him.
And therefore let no man think himself to be altogether happy and contented, till
he hath first attained unto that divine peace
which is in heaven. For it is a thing that doth truly please him that is pleased
himself with this peace. And hereupon may one say, that true peace and contentment
are a true happiness.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is not to be taken to mean the absence of all conversation, or of all rational discourse; but that we should be silent concerning some things, and speak only of those things which are worthy, and proper, and fitting. A true silence, then, is a silence both of tongue and heart, whereby we do both outwardly and inwardly restrain ourselves, and give ourselves up to God, as a living sacrifice and oblation, unto the praise of His name; and to the service and performance of those good works and actions, which are His, and such as become a true Christian, and a faithful servant of Christ. (Puritan).

Now we will look upon the fourth general head of the law; which is the head and author of all moral laws and rules: which we also call the law of nature; or the law of reason. This law is, that every man should consider the nature of the universe, and the relations and dependencies of all things one upon another; and to use and employ his own natural faculties and abilities, with those of his neighbours and companions, so as by their union, the good of the whole may be promoted; and every man, in his own particular and proper office, according to his place, and function; may work <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain. This is a true quality of the righteous and innocent. To endure pain and suffering is a natural concomitant of their innocence and righteousness, as it is a natural consequence of sin and wickedness.

A good and just man doth not grieve and lament for any one, nor doth he fear any one, for he knows that he is innocent of the evil that hath befallen that one. And this he doth understand by a true and sincere belief in the righteousness of himself. For he doth not think that himself hath done any evil, but rather that he is free from all sin and guilt.

If the wicked and sinful man were able to endure pain and suffering, he would be ashamed and grieved, for he knoweth that he is guilty of many evils, and that those evils are the causes of his sufferings. For the soul of a wicked man is in constant trouble and disturbance, for it is always tormented with the knowledge of its own wickedness.

For every sin and wicked deed done by the wicked man, doth it not bring upon him its own fruit, namely, pain and suffering? For that is the natural and natural consequence of every sin and wicked deed. But it is not so with the righteous and innocent, <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life
What is it to be short-lived, and yet to live? What is it to die? If the life that we live, the whole of our being, were so short and transitory as this, it should follow, that a very short life must be as tedious and tedious as one that were long. But the contrary is true, though it is true, that it must follow, that if this our life were long enough, we should have time for all things; if it were short, for some only. And therefore this must be considered, that one man is short of life, another long; if one can live upon nothing, the other must live on all. A long and tedious life must therefore be accompanied and accompanied by a tedious and long life; that which is short, must be accompanied by that which is also short: and that which is not long at all, must be accompanied by that which is also very short. But I must now give an example of a long and tedious life: a man that doth spend the whole day upon one thing; or that doth do nothing at all, but sits, or sleeps.

If a man’s anger doth never cease, he must have a reason to forbear himself. The reason must be some good action or some good resolution, to put the anger to sleep.

To put away anger, let it not be done by the mouth, but by the heart. Let it not be put away by the words and gestures of others, but by the power and virtue of thyself.

For as a man who, with the power of his hands, doth not move or stir his shoulders, doth not make his body move; and yet doth the very spirit of his body move, and doth stir the spirits of all men that are present; so must thou also do. Let not the body move, but the heart of thy body.

As for thy speech, and thy words, let not that be moved by the anger. If the anger doth stir thee up, and doth make thy words and speeches bitter, then put thou away thy anger. If it doth stir up thy heart, and doth make thy words and speeches tender and gracious, then is thy anger right.

So shall the man deal with his anger, that he shall be a true man, and shall be as his father was. And if any <END>

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe, or of God, is this: "Thou must make the heaven, the earth, the waters, and the things of the world, and of the air, and of the fire, all such, as I have made them, and in such fashion, and to such perfection, as they must be in a universe, according to that which I have already said, and in a universe, according to the order and the nature of that which is above." (Gen. ix. 6.)

As, therefore, God is not only the maker, but also the governor, of all things, we must believe that the universe, and all that is in the universe, is governed by that which is above, and that according to the nature and the order, which is above.

And since, for any thing, that can be done or be, it must be, either for one or many, or for no one at all; so that either some one, or many, or none, may be, and do, the same thing; it must either be either for some one, or for some many, or for none, and this it must be either either for the one God, or for the many, or for the one, that is the many. <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death?
As you know, death is the final destiny of all living things, and to face it with courage and equanimity is a good quality.
He is very fortunate that he has not yet died: and is now ready to go away to heaven: but now it is time for him to be gone, for that is his business.
It is good to have a true understanding of one's own mortality, that one may make the most of one's time here, and that one may have a good preparation for that which is to come.
To die well and to live well is the same thing, or at least they are not so far asunder as is commonly conceived.
One thing is certain, that death is the end of all our estates.
Of all things it is good to consider, how to live well; and to die well is to live well, and to live well is to die well.
There are some things which are to be done only in one's life: and some in the life of all men, to whom every man is bound by his natural and common law.
The life of man is to be lived in the manner that it shall be pleasing to God, and to all the good and virtuous men in the world.

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is not to make a man do that, but to inspire and enable a man to do his own proper and natural action. For they that do their own proper and natural actions, and yet are led and guided, as I said, are in a true and happy condition. For it is a happy condition that we are not only able to do our own proper actions, but that also we are able to do other things, by reason of some other; and not only in matters of war and policy; but of religion and of good and of evil; for to be able to do the good, and to be able to do the evil, is a thing of the same nature. Therefore the duty of a leader, is not only to enable and inspire the actions of other men, but also to be able to do his own proper and natural actions, as well as the actions of others.
The duty of a leader is not only to do his own proper and natural actions, but also to do his own proper and natural actions, as well as the actions of others.

For either it doth not happen, or, if it happen, then doth not happen, by the power and operation of some other. If it happen, then by some one's power and operation; if it doth not happen, then it happeneth not by any one's power. The power, therefore, to do as thou wilt, is in thyself.  It is not in another.
Now, how long it shall last, we know not. For it is not for us, either to know it, or to inquire after it. It is better, therefore, if we have no apprehension of it, nor if we are persuaded. The truth, indeed, is known in itself. But we must consider, that the truth is known to us in a particular manner, according to the understanding that we have. And this understanding must be such, that it may be able to comprehend, and to do justice to that which is said.
To this, that the things which are done, are done by the power and operation of God; may be added, that the things which are said, are said by the power and operation of God. For they are spoken <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
Fame, or celebrity status, has been a desirable goal for many people in the past. Some have argued that fame and recognition are essential for achieving their goals in life, and that they provide a sense of importance and status. But is fame really all that it's cracked up to be?

For one, fame is often fleeting. It can come and go in the blink of an eye. One day, you're a famous movie star, the next day, you're a forgotten relic. And even when fame is sustained, it's not always a guarantee of success or happiness. Many famous people have reported feeling unfulfilled, unhappy, and even empty, despite their wealth and status. What's going on?

The problem is that fame is often based on external validation, rather than internal fulfillment. We often measure our self-worth by how much attention we get from others, how many people know us, how many fans we have, and how much we earn. But these external measures are not reliable indicators of our true worth or fulfillment.

Moreover, the pursuit of fame often leads us to prioritize external validation over internal growth and development. We may spend all our time trying to create a persona that will impress others, rather than investing in our own growth and self-im <END>

Will thou still resist His will? Will
Thou still be a stubborn rebel? I

<BEGIN> On the passage of time and the nature of memory.

If a man once hath seen any thing, and hath truly seen it, it is a thing which will everlast, and remain in memory, and be remembered, either as long as he liveth, or as long as memory remaineth with him, which, for the most part, is in his own power to keep and preserve it.

Now it is a true thing, that a man can forget things which, when he doth first see them, didst immediately pass through his mind, or be forgotten; for this, as I said, is a matter of memory, and it doth depend upon the use of the memory.

As for things, which do depend upon the understanding, and are committed to memory, that is to say, those things, which are either known, or can be known, it is the same matter as I said of the memory.

But things that do depend only on the memory, as a thing that can be forgotten, it is a different matter: because the memory, which doth contain it, doth either remember it well, or poorly; and according as it doth remember, it doth either keep it long, or lose it quickly.

And as for a man's memory, it <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is a kind of natural liberty; and it is the only liberty that can be preserved when all men are united together, and speaking the same thing.
It is a liberty that is most free, because it is not subject to any power or authority. For what authority can possibly be able to prevent a man, or any one, from being silent?
And in so doing, he is not only himself free, but he also frees all others. For silence is not only a kind of liberty to oneself, but also to all men. It is also a liberty that is not limited by any bounds. For it is not subject to any condition or circumstance; it is not limited by any particular time or place; it is not limited by any particular occasion or cause; it is not limited by any particular authority or power. For the only condition, or limitation, is, that a man must be true; and must not be deceived or imposed upon.
Now, that these things are true, who can doubt about it? And what is there in the world that is contrary to silence, but the noise of the tongue? What is there that can possibly hinder it, but the power of the world? What is there that can hinder it, but the power of men? For silence <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain is an essential component of suffering, and it is a characteristic that is unique to humans, or so it may seem. For there is evidence to suggest that many other animals may experience a form of suffering that is similar to human suffering, at least in part. This could be due to the fact that many animals are capable of complex emotional experiences such as fear, anger, and sorrow, all of which are closely linked with suffering. Other animals, such as elephants, may experience a form of nostalgia, or wistfulness, that is closely similar to human nostalgia.
The key to the endurance of pain is the ability to perceive the future, and the ability to imagine oneself in various circumstances. This ability, which is commonly referred to as the "future-directedness" of the mind, is a characteristic that is unique to humans, or so it may seem. But again, there is evidence to suggest that other animals may possess this ability, at least in part.
One of the most impressive examples of future-directedness is the ability to form and keep memories. All animals are capable of forming short-term memories, but few animals, if any, are capable of forming long-term memories, or memories that last for many years. Humans, on the other hand, have the ability to <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life: that which is the greatest objection to it is that it is but a very little while.

We have a little time in this world to be able to enjoy our selves; and if the time is short, then it is necessary to use our time better. But the time is short. This time we have is so little, and so short; that a wise man, that is well able to take care of his time, and of his own self; and also of the affairs of other men, must not tarry and be loth, and therefore must not sleep; and must use every day to do something, and something to accomplish, as is usual. If therefore we consider, how very short this life is, and how it will soon be over; then, surely, there is a great reason to use our time, and to take good care of our selves, and of our whole lives. But of all things whatsoever that thou mayest do, if thou wilt but live, and be merry, and happy; as many things are there, that are in thy power, that, in so short a space, thou shalt find such things, that shall be the matter of a very long life, and of a very long discourse.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger and other negative emotions
The great physician Hippocrates, who was the most celebrated physician of ancient Greece, says of anger, that it is the very poison of life. The ancient physicians also held that anger and hatred are a kind of madness, which cannot be cured, and that they must be put to sleep, as one would put to sleep a raging and furious beast, lest it should do some harm. And the same Hippocrates, in his treatise against the physicians, says that anger is a kind of madness; that the cause of anger is in the belly, or in some part of the body; and that it cannot be cured. Some of the physicians also say that it is the stomach, and not the mind, that is the cause of anger. But all men agree, that a certain kind of madness is anger, and that it must be put to sleep, or it must do some great mischief. So also with other passions, and especially with hatred; for this is a kind of madness, that can be cured of only in one way; that is, by putting to sleep; or putting to sleep of the other, as Hippocrates says; for the soul is a kind of wild beast, and must be put to sleep, or put to sleep <END>

A man was once going through the wilderness with his servants. As he journeyed, he became faint, and his servants told him of his weakness. He said unto them: "You shall not be faint; if you see an animal come, and devour its prey; tell them that I have come to my end, for I have found it out, and now my body doth feel like a stone." His servants said: "We pray thee, if the creature which devours its prey, and diggets, and diggest again, doth this to provide meat for itself; how can it also be said, that the man shall have a meat?" This man is an example to those that are in the wilderness, for their meat is their bread: that is their meat, and it is their bread: and thus they are satisfied; for as the man that said, that if he devoured his own flesh, or dig <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger in the workplace
Anger is a very difficult emotion to deal with in the workplace. It is a powerful feeling that can sometimes be overwhelming, and it can cause problems in relationships with colleagues. However, dealing with anger in the workplace is a crucial aspect of maintaining a good working relationship. Here are some tips on how to deal with anger in the workplace.
Recognize that your anger may be justified.
Before dealing with the anger, you need to recognize that your anger may be justified. Ask yourself if the person who is causing your anger is being unreasonable or disrespectful. If you feel that their actions are unjustified, then it's likely that you are justified in feeling angry.
Talk to the person who caused your anger.
If you feel that your anger is justified, then the best way to deal with it is to talk to the person who caused it. Explain how their actions affected you and why you feel the need to address the issue. Be calm and objective when talking to them.
Use "I" statements.
When talking to the person who caused your anger, use "I" statements. This means that you express your feelings and thoughts using the word "I". For example, "I feel angry when you interrupt me when I am talking". This way of expressing yourself <END>

For as that which was made with a little care and consideration, doth continue still after its being made, in the same state wherein it was made, and it is not the case of anything that was made, that it should be made again, as if it had been made that which is now, and not that which it was before.

By the hand of a madman.

Hence all the world, hath a particular hatred and fear towards death, which is the general fate of all men, and that which will befall them, at last, and when their turn comes, they are afraid of it. They think that death, as a general fate, will bring them no more to see the world, and to do those things, which are the chief ends, of human life, and so it may be said, that they fear death, and yet they fear nothing, which can happen to them. For so, from a certain period of time, after it had come upon some particular man, he was no longer afraid of it; for then he was no more. But, in all men, that which is afraid, is but fear; and that which is gone away, is gone away for ever. This therefore is the truth of it: that there is no fear, but fear of death. All the rest of things, that any man can fear, is nothing but death, in one or other shape. If therefore a man would avoid death, he must avoid fear of death; and the only way to do this, is to put his heart upon it, and not to be afraid <END>

The latter part of this tractate, especially the last sentence, is not a very proper subject for a serious discourse; and is so far from the matter, that it is not even a subject of discourse; but of the nature and essence of that very matter, which, I say, is not contrary to nature.
The truth of all things, is that all things are either in their true nature, or in that of things contrary to their true nature. I say contrary to their true nature, for in that true nature there is not such a thing as contradiction; for there are no things, of which either the nature itself is contradictory, or that which is contrary to their nature is contradictory.
Therefore, if a man may be said to live according to nature, as long as he is in a state of indifference: it is a very good and right thing, that all things, which are contrary to nature, should be put away, and taken away: and yet it is also a very good and right thing, that all things, which are contrary to nature, should <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless.
Fame, as a thing, is but a mere shadow of that which is truly desirable, a thing of nothing. A shadow is a dark and empty appearance, which doth give a false and deceitful appearance to the thing itself, which it doth resemble. A shadow, as such, is but a mere nothing, and a non-entity: but that which doth cast this shadow, that which doth cast this false appearance, and that which doth give this deceitful appearance, is something very different: a being of a different kind, and a different nature.

It is true, that that which doth cast this shadow, or give this false appearance, is a thing, which is indeed some one thing, or substance, and not a mere nothing. But yet, that which doth cast this shadow, or give this false appearance, is not the thing, but a different thing, and a different substance. It is not the thing, that doth give this false appearance; but a thing of a different nature, and a different kind.

Now, how this may be understood, when that which doth cast this shadow, or give this false appearance, is some one thing, or substance, let us consider. That which doth cast <END>

If thou see any city ill governed, or troubled with evil passions, I suppose thou wilt not wish to remove unto that city. If it were in thy power, thou shouldst rather be moved to reform it. And if it should happen that thou art in that very city, which thou hast found to be ill governed, or troubled with evil passions, take heed, and be not put off by those things, which by nature are to be found in any city, which are not very different from one city unto another: that thou mayest reform the evils.

Hercules and Atlas were once friends and companions; and Plato, as it is well known, had been an associate of the Stoics, and one of them; and it is said, that Aristotle was also one, though he was not a member of their sect. For he, who did not suffer himself to be controlled, and whose mind was not altogether disposed to suffer anything, could not be a partaker in the same principles, and the same ways, with them. And so the world may say of many that are called friends of the world: "How came they to be friends with him, who is the very opposite of his own nature?" But the reason of this is, that they did not really understand him.

The other cause, of their friendship, was, that they were united in their way, and in their course. And so they were, though Hercules and Atlas were enemies. For it is not every way, that men are enemies; and it is not every course, that men are enemies. For the nature of the soul, is to live and to move, and to do.

It is a virtue which is most dear unto the hearts of those who are of the right mind, and of them that are properly disposed unto virtues: for that of all the virtues is there most contained, and most cherished and reverenced.

And, behold! What is the fruit and effect of this virtue, when it shall be well taken in, and properly observed. First, it doth make a man of great contentment: because, when he shall find himself, either with his own hands, or by the hands of others, to have wrought that which is good and profitable, and justly right and true, he shall be contented. Secondly, it doth make him of good humour: because, if any man, either through some inward defect, or some outward accident, or some particular occasion, doth vex or trouble his mind, and get his temper against others, the virtue of silence will easily take away, and remove all these vexations and troubles, from the man's mind, and temper.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain
The human body is a machine that is made of many parts, and yet it is very well fitted to endure pain. If the parts of the body, like the muscles and the tendons, were not very well fitted to bear the pains that are incident to the motion and action of the body, we should not be able to walk, run, or work, but must lie and suffer from the pain of every movement and action. For this very reason, therefore, that the parts of our body are well fitted to bear pain, is a great reason why the body should not be destroyed; for in many cases, if the body were destroyed, the pain of destruction would be very great. For every part of the body must bear its own pains, as well as suffer its own destruction; but that of the body itself, is the destruction of all those parts. (Eustathius, Homily 17)

Summary of the topic
The topic of the human body's endurance of pain is a fundamental aspect of Christian theology. The body is seen as a machine that is well-suited to bear the pains and sufferings of life, and as such, it is not destroyed, but rather, it is preserved.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger or other emotions
The chief part of thy wisdom and understanding, is thy power of dealing with all passions and affections of the mind, especially with that of anger, that most violent and most troublesome of all, which, if thou wilt not be ruled by it, it will be a plague unto thee, a bane unto the world. The same thing is spoken of it in the word of the Lord: 'A hot-tempered man, what he can do, shall he be able to do it?' (Psalm cxvi. 36.) The whole world is not full of such men, but there is no man so good, as to have none of them. And among all other passions, anger is the most dangerous, because of the confusion it makes in the understanding. A man that is angry, doth not know, whereto to turn his thoughts: and the understanding itself is confounded. And as for the passions themselves, they do also vary: one man is angry, another is joyful; another is sorrowful; and another is puffed up, with pride. (Titus iii. 2.)

<BEGIN> How to face death with courage and confidence?
Facing death with courage and confidence is not about being reckless, but about having a deep understanding of life and death, and a strong faith in a higher power. It involves facing our fears, being honest about our own mortality, and trusting in a transcendent power.
Here are some steps to help you face death with courage and confidence:
1. Reflect on the nature of death: Understanding that death is a natural part of life can help us to be more at peace.
2. Develop a strong faith: Having a faith in a higher power can give us the confidence to face death with courage and confidence.
3. Be honest about your own mortality: Acknowledge your own limitations and vulnerability.
4. Cultivate a sense of hope: Even in the face of death, there is always hope of an afterlife, a higher purpose, or a reunion with loved ones who have passed on.
5. Live a life of integrity: Living a life of integrity, honesty, and compassion can help us to die with dignity and peace.

For, if any one of them is convinced, that another of his tenets is false, he would never again believe in the whole, because the parts are all false. They also suppose the universe to be governed by a single providence, which is the same, for the whole world; but as the parts of a world, as it were, do not agree in their principles: and this also is contrary to reason; and to the opinion of Plato, that all things that exist, must have their cause, as in Plato's Timaeus and Phaedo, where it is said, that all things that exist, must be governed by a common principle: and this they suppose, to be an infinite multitude of gods, who do govern all the parts of the world: whereas a single providence, that is one only, would be far more reasonable, and would far more agree with Plato's opinion.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless?
The following reasons explain why fame is meaningless, or may even be a curse in disguise.
It brings many hardships. The fame, in this case, is that which the ignorant and the foolish, who are blind to what is true, may boast of; for they are not at all aware that what is false may be called by the same name that is true; for if the thing itself were false, and that which is false were called true; that would be the same as saying that what is false were called true.
The former cause. Why it is not to be desired to have a name. Why it is not to be desired to have a name, is obvious enough. For the cause why a name is given to a man or a thing is, because it is believed to be or to be worthy of a certain honour.
What a name is, is in truth a mere word, which is given to anything that is believed to be or worthy of honour. Why therefore are those that are not worthy of honour called honourable? It is because it is a word and not a deed: and because they are called honourable because they are not called dishonourable.

For happiness, properly so called, is not but one kind, namely, the happiness of the mind. And in that we find that peace, and a certain tranquillity of mind and feeling, which is that which we just now spoke of. It is this then which is one of the chief goods; for it is that of which it is said that happiness is that one. Of the other things, one is said to be a good. For it is said, that he is good, who is merciful, and benevolent. And of the other things, one is said to be a pleasure.

<BEGIN> On the passage of time and the things that men say, it is necessary to consider what things they speak truly and falsely. For it is possible to speak falsely with the tongue, yet not with the heart. And it is necessary, not only to know the true words, which God hath spoken, and to know those of man, which he hath also spoken; but also to know, when any man doth say, that he speaketh truly, it is possible he doth not speak truly; or if he do speak truly, yet not of the matter of things; or if he do speak truly of the matter, yet not of that manner. For example: 'It is a good deed, which thou hast done. It is a good thing, which God hath done. It is a good thing, which God hath spoken.' Now these words are spoken truly of the matter; yet of a different manner. For God hath spoken; not that God should do any thing; but that God doth do some thing.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is not that of keeping quiet, but of keeping one’s mind quiet. We do well to be silent and keep our minds still; as for speaking, let it be as much as may be necessary and sufficient to those ends that thou dost intend by speaking. To be silent, or to keep one’s mind quiet, is not unbecoming of any one. I can say nothing against it, as a matter of right and proper duty. In short, to be quiet is that which is natural and proper to beget that which is truly natural and proper, and it is this also that is most agreeable to God. Whereof it may be further understood by the words of St. John: “Thou shalt not speak against any man in his lifetime. Be not quick to mind; but remember all things; that the Lord thy God may have mercy upon thee. (1 John 3: 1. )
The virtue of silence is that of keeping one’s mind quiet. Silence is not the keeping quiet of the voice, but of the mind. To keep quiet, is to keep a mind at peace; and to do this, is to keep quiet. A mind that is quiet and still, and that is not disturbed, is very properly and truly silent <END>

But it is not written in any one word, nor in any one place, and is not of so much consequence. Yet is it a most excellent and profitable thing, if thou wilt only use it with all due and becoming respect, to think that which is necessary, and necessary.

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life and its various relations and connections; and a dialogue concerning the nature of the soul. That this life of ours is short, it is most evident from this, that the bodies that were first made, were but of a very short time; for they were first made but a little after the time of their creation: but yet in the time that they were in their first formation, they had of it a part of one day's duration; for the earth was made in the first day; and the first man also was made in that one day; and the sun and the moon also were made in the same day. And from that time forward all those bodies were made; and there were many of them, and of their own nature they had a natural shortness of life; and all of them were shorted from the time when the earth and the heaven were made, to the time that they were corrupted: and for that corruption, I do believe that there is no particular time fixed; for this earth to be corrupted, or to be destroyed, is a thing of time, and a time which may not be determined. Therefore the shortness of this life of ours, cannot be known, as long as the time of its beginning is not known: and for that time <END>

Anger, that is, uncontrolled rage and furiousness of temper, is the more pernicious to us, the more dangerous is it to all others. For when the anger is contained and is kept in, it is dangerous to us only; but when it breaks out and is thrown off, it is dangerous to others, who are by its violence hurt or injured. But let this be a sufficient lesson to us; that we may the more carefully preserve the tranquility of our own minds, and deal with our own anger in a more gentle and temperate manner. For an uncontrolled temper and furiousness of mind is the more pernicious, because it is dangerous to all that are near it; and it is better for one, that is angry, than for one that is hurt by another's anger, that is to say, than for one that is angry, than for one that is hurt.

From this it follows that the knowledge and understanding of many things are derived, which do not belong unto them either, but unto the general intellect, and to the whole common reason: for the intellect and understanding are general, and common, and universal; and are not confined unto particular things; but embrace all things. And so the knowledge of many things is common to all things, which belong unto them; and therefore it is not to be denied, that the intellect and understanding is common.

A new thing is what presently doth operate in the world; which the world being always changing, and the things that happen in it ever new, that is the very essence of the world; which that it may be, doth happen.

And it is this that maketh him to be always in a state of expectation, ready to answer any thing. For if anything new happen in the world, the understanding and knowledge of that thing.

In the days of Socrates, and even of Plato, and Aristotle, what was the usual condition and state of mind of the citizens of Athens? They lived in the midst of the world, yet they were not worldly: they lived among the citizens of the world, yet they were not worldly. They lived in the midst of their own particular society, and that society was the mean of all, but it was not a society of pleasure, nor a society of pleasure, but of virtue.

How much more was the condition of the Stoic philosophers! They had no need to go to any other place to enjoy anything, because in the same place they could find all things. They could not be pained, neither pleased, nor delighted: they could not be angry, neither delighted: they could not be pleased, nor offended: they could not be pained, nor pleased.

In the midst of all these things, what is it to a man? what is it to a man, to live? to be a citizen of Athens, or of Rome? What is it, to be of a nation? To be of a nation, is to be a part of it, to be a member of it: to be a member of it <END>

Pain is not a passion, but a part of the soul's natural constitution. Pain is a manifestation of the soul's desire for health, which it finds unaccomplished. Pain is not a pain, but a pain that is needed, a pain that is necessary for the soul's preservation, and is therefore worthy of endurance.
The Stoic Epicureans had a similar opinion of pain. For the Epicure, pain was a natural and necessary part of human life, which could not be avoided; but it must be endured with patience and fortitude.
The Stoics therefore said, that pain was not to be avoided, but endured: not in a sense that it is to be continued in, but in a sense that it is to be borne patiently. The Stoic said: What can be done, I will do it; but for things which lie not in my power, I will endure patiently and silently. And such are the things that happen in life.
For the pain itself is a matter of indifference; the patience and the endurance, a matter of true and sincere virtue. The Stoic, therefore, says, that he is willing to endure any pain, which is natural to him. For the natural is the true, and the true is <END>

For in whatsoever things it is, that happen to the many, is subject to the laws of nature and reason; and therefore not anything ill happeneth to them, that is not according to nature; for whatsoever things they do, is subject to the laws of nature and reason.

To the Reader, By which I have been enabled to understand that there is nothing in the universe which can or should be made or changed, by reason or use.

There is also a certain kind of particular nature of things, whereby they may have a more certain and lasting being, than either as particular substances, or as particular species or kinds. I will not say of anything that it cannot be changed or altered, but of those things that are by nature more stable and firm, it cannot be changed or altered without a great and proper reason; which reason, by a natural law, and according to nature, ought not to be altered without a proper and worthy cause.

<BEGIN> How to face death? and how to meet with death. Death is not a thing that we should fear: and yet many a man, out of a mere habit of nature, doth shun the thought of death: and yet doth fear his own life as if it were a thing precarious. It is a matter of some difficulty to know, when a man shall meet with death: but there are some signs, which do often foretell death. It is an evil and a curse to live as a sensualist, or a carnal man; to be contented with a little, to seek for much, and to desire a greater abundance: and to desire that which is forbidden. To live contented and quiet. It is not so much to desire what is good and right, as to take the care of doing good and right. The soul that is so proud, so arrogant, that is so much bent upon self, that is so much bent upon herself, that she is not so much bent upon all men, that is, she is not so much bent upon the common good, is that soul, whose death it is: that soul that is not contented, that is not quiet, is that soul, whose death it is, that is, the soul that is <END>

And he ought also to be wise, and able to discern, that which is expedient for his kingdom, and for his people.

For it is not fit that a leader should carry himself without a sense of his own office, or without a sense of his own duty. But then, it is also not fit, that a leader should be proud and haughty, or that he should be too much affected with his own power and dignity. For this, and for that, is the common error and fault of all those who are governed; and that is, that they are either too proud, or too weak. The latter is not of a reasonable nature; but the former is a thing most foul, and most loathsome.

God also, hath appointed thyself a partaker of his sovereignty; and hath given thee authority over that, which is both good, and necessary: Thou therefore must also, act accordingly as thou wouldst that they should. This is the true and necessary nature of our life, as Christians; not to live to thy own pleasure, and will, but to God's pleasure, and will. So that we must always be in the mind and intention of God's glory: And then, in sooth, we must be always in the right.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless, according to the Buddha
The Buddha taught that one of the greatest obstacles to achieving enlightenment is our craving for fame and recognition. Here are a few teachings of the Buddha on why fame is meaningless. He taught:
"The world is full of fame, fame, fame! Yet none of it is true. What a wonder that a man should take heed of fame and praise, when such is the nature of the world that all praise and all praise's worth is false?" (A. II, p. 246)

"If you do not find that you are of the world, then your praise will be of little use. And the praise that is spoken of by the world, is not true, nor is it good, and the world of men is full of praise and praise. What is the use of it? But when you know that the world is not the world, and is but a shadow of the real world, then is your praise of good." (A. I, p. 183)

The present hour is the beginning of time; that is, the time in which that hour is. But if any thing should come to pass, that the present hour should not be, then, as we have said, the present time would not be the beginning of time; and thus would not be time. For if time should not begin in the present hour, then it would begin in the present hour of some other. And thus would not be one time, but many times; which is absurd.
But the present hour is the beginning of time. For as the present is the beginning of the future; so it must also be the beginning of the present, as a sort of intermediate period between the two. For what is the present, but a succession of present moments, which follow each other, and one after another. Thus the present is not time; but a kind of time; for time is the succession of moments, which have a beginning, and a

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is very seldom found in a private man. Every man hath his own peculiar opinions; some are loud-mouthed; some are talkative and loquacious. Some are apt to give their opinions; and some do not. But what can be the cause that any man should choose rather to be silent, than to be understood, and to be heard, and to give his opinion? Do not they know, that whatsoever they speak or say, they are heard? What they say, is understood: and what they do, is observed. Let us then take heed, and use our words to do good. Let us therefore choose rather to speak of things, that we may do them; and to speak against those things, that we may not do them. And let us rather speak of those things, that are worthy to be spoken against, than of those things, that are worthy to be spoken of.

The virtue of silence is a virtue of the mind. The mind is silent, when she is in her own quiet and quietness, and in her own rest. The mind is not silent, when she is busy, and active; but when she is not, and at rest, then she is silent. The mind is silent, when she is not troubled, nor <END>

Of what manner of thing the apostle is speaking when he says, That their way of dealing with anger is not right: that is, that they do not use their patience to turn away their wrath from them? He speaks of this kind of anger as one that is not truly angry; for they who are angry with a spirit, and not with the flesh, are not angry at all. It is true, they do use their patience; but not for the turning of their wrath away: For there is no patience for the wrath of an angry man. And then they are angry with their angry spirits only: but that spirit is not truly angry; for there is no anger that is not mixed with the flesh. So that they deal with the anger of their spirits: and they deal with no true anger.
As for the rest, they do not turn away their wrath from them; because it is not their wrath which they do turn away. For it is the wrath of men only, that we should turn away; and that of men, the wrath of men only, that is not turned away.

<BEGIN> How to face death: The Buddhist view
In Buddhism, death is not seen as a bad omen, but rather as an opportunity for spiritual growth. The Buddhist view of death is that of impermanence. All phenomena are impermanent, and death is a natural part of life. Here, one can see that it is not the fear of death, but the fear of what is not, that causes anxiety and suffering.
In the Mahayana tradition, death is seen as an opportunity to achieve enlightenment. The deceased has the opportunity to be reborn in a more excellent state, and so the deceased can benefit from their karma. In other words, death is an opportunity for the deceased to be reborn as a Buddha. If a man or a woman dies as an atheist, without a single virtuous action, and without having attained enlightenment, their own mind will be their own hell and their own hellish condition.
The fear of death is also related to the fear of what is not. When we fear death, we fear what is not: death itself. Death is not a thing, and therefore it does not exist. Yet it is what we fear, and it is what makes us anxious. So the fear of death is the fear of what is not. Death itself does not <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader, especially the one that is most influential among many, is to maintain peace, and to be a patron to the arts. In other words, his duty is to defend the church and the true religion. To do this he must be able to persuade many men. This is not only the case with a leader of a religion, but even with a commonwealth. A general or a king, that can bring his men together and persuade them, is more likely to achieve a victory than one that is unable to do so. A commander who cannot persuade his soldiers, must therefore always be in a sorry state, even though his men be well trained and well provided. This also is the case in the art of war. When the commanders have not the power of persuasion, and do not know how to use it, the war is always the worse, not only for those who are commanded, but even for those who are commanding themselves. For every man who is commanded, is always afraid of being put to death, or otherwise punished.

As a river floweth by, and never standeth still; and a tree doth grow and spread itself abroad; so doth a man's knowledge grow by him.

## Step 1:  Understand the purpose and content of the passage.
The passage is discussing the nature of truth and the ability of the human mind to comprehend and understand it. The author emphasizes that truth is not just a matter of external authority, but rather it can be understood by anyone through reason and contemplation.

## Step 2:  Identify the main arguments and concepts presented in the passage.
The author argues that truth is not dependent on external authority or tradition, but rather it can be understood by reason and contemplation. The mind is seen as a vessel capable of receiving and comprehending all truth, and the ability of the mind to do justice is its ability to understand and apply truth.

Wherefore it is, that such a mind, which doth not properly know and understand, is apt to fix its thoughts on some one object or matter; whether it be some one man, some one action, or some one event; and that she doth not properly understand and know, what the nature of that object, or matter, is, either of itself, or of herself. That is, what is the nature of the one man, or of that one action, or of that one event; and that, which she doth know, of herself, is not the true knowledge, which she would have; and that, which she doth know of her own mind, that she would not know; for then would she know that which she would not know.

There is a general agreement amongst men of sound judgment, that the passage of time is one of the most sensible things in the world. For so it is, that whatsoever is in the world, is either subject to decay, or subject to decay it must; and in that very decay, is a natural passage of time. In this respect, there is no one that can dispute it, but such as are blinded with some conceit or opinion, to prevent it from being known, and understood by all that truly know.

Therefore, the passage of time, must needs be the most sensible thing in the world. And I pray, let them that will dispute against it, either be blind, or be ignorant, or else, it must needs be, that they are as one of those things that are subject to decay. And this, that may be perceived, either by observation, or by argument. For that which is subject to decay, doth manifest it self to every man, either by observation of things that have happened, or by argument of things that must be.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence. To be silent is an exercise of the moral faculty, which is the very essence of virtue. And of all things, the most beautiful and pleasing, is the silence of a virtuous man.

The first thing in which to begin, is that we should use all those powers that are proper to a virtuous man, with that grace and beauty. Now the grace and beauty, of all things, is most pleasing in itself: But especially that of a virtuous man, when he exercises those powers that are proper unto him, with grace and beauty. That which is most proper unto a virtuous man, is his discourse. But if he discourse with grace and beauty, what is it but the most proper thing of all? Now of all things, that which is most proper unto him, is that his discourse is pure, and free from any unbecoming, or impure words.

To speak with purity, and purity of heart, is a thing of great difficulty: especially if the heart be not pure, and if the heart be impure, the mouth cannot be pure, but it will speak of things that are not worthy: but if the heart be pure, the mouth cannot be impure, but it will speak of things that are worthy.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain, and suffering, as a virtue. I may ask, is it a virtue to be strong against pain; is it a virtue, to endure it willingly? Or to bear it patiently? That, I suppose, is the point of the question; and that, indeed, is the common reception and interpretation of it, by those who have ever considered it.

I will give a simple answer, and without much trouble. That it is not a virtue to bear pain, but a duty. To endure pain, or to suffer willingly, I take to be a duty of nature, and of the whole rational nature of man. And yet it is not a duty, which is at all times incumbent. It is not a duty, which every one must perform. It is not a duty, which any man is bound by law to perform.

And so, when a man is called upon to endure pain, it is not for the virtue of his character, but for the reason of his condition, that he must perform it. As for the virtue, the character, the disposition of one, that will be able to endure pain willingly, that is not the virtue of endurance of pain; but is rather the virtue of patience and moderation.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger and anger management
Anger is an emotion that affects the heart and soul, and can be a challenge to manage in a healthy and constructive way. Anger can be a necessary response to a threat, and it can motivate us to stand up for ourselves, take action, and make positive changes. However, unmanaged anger can lead to harm to ourselves and others, as well as damage to our relationships and well-being.
Dealing with anger involves recognizing its presence, understanding its root cause, and finding healthy ways to manage it. Here are some strategies to help you manage anger:
1. Acknowledge and accept your anger.
Recognize that your anger is present and valid, even if you don’t want to admit it to yourself. Avoid suppressing or denying your anger, as this can make it harder to manage. Instead, acknowledge and accept your anger as a natural emotion.
2. Identify the root cause of your anger.
Reflect on why you’re angry and what you can do about it. Ask yourself questions like “What am I really upset about? What can I do about it? Is there someone else who can help me with this problem?
3. Take a time-out.
Sometimes, anger can be overwhelming and all-consuming. Take a break and give yourself some space <END>

In the same manner also that a man by nature hath a natural desire to preserve his own body, and to keep it in soundness and health, and to be in such a state as that it should not be disabled; so hath also every man a natural desire to preserve his soul, and to keep it in a state of soundness, health and happiness, as that it should not be disabled; and to be in such a state, as that it should be a well ordered and well disposed part of his own self; as that he should be able, and willing to do that which is good, and righteous, and true.
But what of one, or two, or three, or few that doth desire the common good, and the good and right? they may yet be, in sooth, very properly and properly <END>

Socrates. What doth thy mind say to this matter? What doth thou think of it, and what doth it mean?

Therapeut. Why do we, O Socrates, go into these things?

Socrates. It is not for thee, as a philosopher, to know or to teach that which is the true meaning of those words. For such is the nature of the matter, that they are all confused and obscure to thee, as long as thou art ignorant of those other things, that I have already said to thee.

And when thou dost know those things, thou shalt be able to speak with true understanding of that also. For a philosopher is he, not one that doth speak in words, but one that doth speak with understanding and reason, as is proper to him. For that is the proper work of a philosopher, to speak with understanding and reason. And thou, Therapeut, hast a great knowledge of many things, both of the ancient Greeks, and of other nations; and therefore I think it fitting, that thou shouldst speak with the rest, and speak to them.

<BEGIN> On the behavior of others. There is something that I will say of others. The reason of the whole of the world, as it is said, is one. But for the parts, their parts are many; as a single eye for all things, for the parts of the universe: that which is done by many, it is done by a single eye; but what is done by a single eye, that which is done by many. Therefore, they that have all things under their command, they only will consider themselves; and for that part that is under their command, they will consider others. Therefore, they that are under their command, will also consider themselves only; and for that which they consider themselves, they will consider others. The whole universe is as a body of a man. And that which is under the command of the head of a body of a man, that is what is said by some; what is under the head of a man, that is what is said by some. And what is under a man, that is what is said by some. The head of a man is that part of his body that is over all of his other parts. For to do something, and to be in some one place, it is necessary that the other part of him should be <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless. Fame and glory are but mere baubles. The only true glory is to live a life of virtue and honor. The end of all human actions is either pleasure or pain, and that the greatest pain that man can suffer is to live an improper life. To be free is not the same as to be happy, but to live and act freely and intelligently is the same thing as to be happy. And thus to be happy is to live a life of virtue and honor. And thus to live a life of virtue and honor is to be happy. And thus to be happy and to live a life of virtue and honor is the same thing as to be free. The end of all human actions is either pleasure or pain. The greatest pain that man can suffer is to live an improper life. A man is not happy if he be not free to act and speak and to go on or to go from. He that is not free to act and speak and to go on or to go from is not happy, but he who is free and honest and virtuous, is happy and blessed. A man is not happy if he be not free and honest and virtuous, but a man that is free and honest and virtuous, is happy and blessed. The <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace, or the true nature of things, there is a sense of contentment or satisfaction. In this sense it is called " contentment". For in this sense the mind, or understanding, doth find that true tranquillity of the mind, which is the same as true peace.
The first thing that is necessary to get at a true peace, is to set the affections, and appetites of the mind, out of the way: but as for the matter itself, which is peace, I must confess I know not what it is.
For in general, the whole nature of man doth consist of a body, a soul, and appetites; and the soul, or understanding, doth always govern the body and appetites, as a lord governeth his subjects. The soul, or understanding, therefore, must be in a state of perfect peace and tranquillity, and this is that true peace, that the apostle doth speak of, in the Epistle to Philemon; For in general, all that is called true peace, is but a true tranquillity of the mind. For that which is called tranquillity of mind, doth not mean but that the mind be free from all those perturbations and troubles <END>

<BEGIN> On the passage of time: A meditation
of the first age of the world. For those things which are commonly known, the understanding of which is not easy, thou must not be content to pass over them with a cursory look, or a general conception; but must consider them and ponder over them, as for themselves, and not merely for their reference to those things, which, by common usage and consent, are commonly called _history_; nor must thou confound them, or make them to differ as different times do, for in such a manner the past cannot be truly known, neither can any thing else be truly known; for in order to know any thing, we must have the former times; and what are they, but those very times themselves; which it is not possible for any one to know, unless it be by some means that is peculiar, and can be performed only by the eye, and that only by one that has a pure eye.

(Note of a manuscript written in Latin.)

It is written by Papias of Hierapolis; who had a pure eye. (Note of Papias of Hierapolis; who is said by Origen to be the very last of the prophets.)

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence. As for the silence of a woman, there is no natural reason for her to be silent. A woman is a woman, a woman is a part of the human race, and a part of the human race is not bound by any law or covenant to speak. But women are not naturally bound to the laws and covenants of man; but to the laws and covenants of God. And God has given no such law or covenant as should command any woman to speak, unless it were in her husband's house, which is but a domestic covenant, not binding upon her. In the house, she may speak with her husband, but not elsewhere; and with her children, but not with any other woman; but in her own mind she may be silent, as all reasonable and godly women are bound to be.
Many women also who are married, are silent, not only in public, but also in the private house of their husbands; as for instance, the wife of the apostle, Priscilla. Many women also who are not married, are silent, as for example, the wife of St. Paul. For many women are not bound by any law or covenant to speak, as the wife of a married man. In the house of <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain
Pain can be considered a source of endurance, for if any man were able, as the Stoics say, to endure any external thing whatsoever, as the pain of a sore, the fume of the air, the cold or heat, the noise or the stench, his own body would suffer pain, if he would but bear it. The Stoics also speak of the end of human life, as of a general suffering of pain: but, in a peculiar way, it is said, that in the time of the fall of Jerusalem, or other great calamities, that in them was included a great multitude of pains, which did attend the death of many. For as that which doth happen, either naturally, or according to the ordinance of God, doth contain in it, a great multitude of things which doth happen, and the causes of those things, so likewise doth that which is done, either by nature, or by the permission of God, contain in it a great multitude of pains and miseries, and many other things of the like nature. The Stoics also say, that if a man would but suffer for his own sins, or for the sins of others, or for the sins of his parents, and their parents <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life
The very essence of all that is human is, to be always in a state of change and motion. That, which was yesterday a thing that could not have happened, is now become possible; which which was not before the present hour, is now come to pass. As we said, that which was yesterday not, is now a thing that is; and which was not before the present hour, is now become. The whole world of men, as they are now, was yesterday not: all that, which is now, was yesterday not: and all that, which shall be tomorrow, was before; yet now it is come into being, and now it is; and it shall yet be.

But it is a very shortness of life. What a part of time is one whole year to the age of man? What a part is one whole day? For as for all that doth happen, and all that is done, it is but a few moments; so for all that is past and gone, it is but a few hours. For if thou wouldst make a time for all that is past, and gone away, thou couldst not, but make it but as many hours, as there are things to make time for; and as many <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger: when it doth arise, as often as it doth; either let it be expressed and spoken, or be suppressed. When expressed and spoken, the best method is, that you should use some common reason and argument, that shall convince the angry man that he doth speak ill, and that it is not proper, or natural, for him to speak thus; and then to change his manner: when suppressed, be careful that it doth not rise again; and that it shall not be a secret and a hidden thing, but that it shall be open and plain in itself; or, if it were hidden, let it be understood that thou art angry: that it may be known unto thee, and unto others, what thou art angry at, that thou mayest be understood, and not be ignorant of what thou art angry at.

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe and its fundamental laws.

The universe is infinite in size; and therefore, as its parts are infinite, it must also be infinite; and the parts of infinite things are infinite. It is not possible that any finite thing can be within any infinite thing. For to the infinite there are not equal things, either, for it is not possible that any finite thing can be equal to anything else. If there were any finite things, and of that sort also as the infinite things, they must be finite; and therefore, not able to contain a finite thing within it. They are all unequal: therefore there can be none of any kind within any other. All that is finite is unequal; and all that is unequal, finite; and therefore all things, finite or infinite, are either or the other. Thus the universe and its parts must also be of two kinds.

That the universe is infinite, cannot be proved either by reason, or by observation. For as for proof by observation, the things that are observed, are of all things, inferior or inferior, equal and unequal; but whatsoever of any kind, be it inferior or superior, is observed, of one thing only can it be observed, as of one, and not of two things; and so can this be <END>

Death is one of the mysteries of life. Death is the end of everything that we are. And, yet, how shall we be able to die with courage? How shall we die like men and like Christians? Hereby we shall be able to face death with courage: To take care of our souls, and of the world to come. For death is but a removal. The soul is not bound. The soul is the very thing that shall live for ever; and to be separated from it, is to be deprived of that very life, and to be left to die. To fear the pains of death. To be afraid of the torments of hell. To be afraid of the pains of purgatory, and the torments of hell, and the wrath of God, is the proper cause and effect of eternal death. To fear, is a sin; and the proper effect of a sin, is eternal death. To be afraid of death, and to fear the torments of hell, is but a natural effect, and a proper effect. For all creatures are afraid of death and of hell; but it is not so with him, that doth fear of them. To fear is to be afraid; to fear to fear, is to <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless. By Henry Ward Beecher (American minister, orator, and writer).

## Step 1: Understand the context of the statement.
The statement seems to be a reflection on the nature of fame and its relation to human fulfillment. It is presented as a philosophical musing from the perspective of Henry Ward Beecher, a well-known American minister and orator.

## Step 2: Interpret the content of the statement.
Beecher's statement likely discusses the ephemeral nature of fame and its lack of substantial value in human experience. He may argue that fame does not lead to a more fulfilling life, happiness, or spiritual growth.

## Step 3: Identify the key arguments presented in the statement.
The key arguments in Beecher's statement would involve the nature of fame, its impact on human experience, and the distinction between what truly brings fulfillment and happiness versus the external trappings of fame.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Why fame is meaningless. By Henry Ward Beecher (American minister, orator, and writer).}$ <END>

Many things in this world, which might appear as very trifling to some, are as it were, the very roots of life and the foundation of its growth, so as without them the whole is nothing but a mere fancy or imagination, or, if thou wilt, a mere bubble or fleeting dream. But let us return to our present subject, which is to find peace and tranquility, that is to say, the true quiet of the soul. To this, first thou must direct thy thoughts: for, as is the rule in all other things, so also it is with the soul. First, therefore, take care, to get thyself in the mind of a man who is in possession of a good and sound judgment. Then, thou must also take care of a good conscience: for this, thou must, in all things, strive to do right, and not to do anything which is contrary to thy conscience. Next, thou must be diligent about the well-being of thy body: and as much as it is in thy power, use such food, and such company, and such recreation, as are most conducive to health and strength. And when thou hast got thyself in a good posture, and that thy soul be in <END>

<BEGIN> On the passage of time, I was particularly interested and I must say that it is not only the time which is passing by, but also the age of men and of things. This is that which in my opinion is of greatest use to the soul; but whether it can be taught and learned by means of any other things than what we have said, I am not able to determine.
The question therefore is, whether it can be taught and learned by means of any other things than what we have said. I ask thee, O friend, whether that which we have said, can any other way be understood or received? Whether it is not to be understood by one that is familiar with the nature and disposition of the universe, and of the things which are in it. For example, that the earth and the heaven are one. Or that which is said in the sacred scriptures of the Egyptians, "that they that shall not be able to be purified by any means whatsoever." For all these and for such, which by some are interpreted, are to be understood only by the interpretation of the universe. And so that which is said in the scriptures, that there is nothing which shall be, either that it shall not be, or that it shall be. Whether it is or whether it shall not, <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is not to be confounded with that of being silent: a man that doth not speak, doth not therefore possess the virtue of silence: he is a silent man; but his silence doth not signify his virtue. He that doth speak, is not a man without virtue: because he is not a man of wickedness, but he is a man that is speaking virtue: and speaking virtue, is the same thing as speaking the truth, as speaking honestly, and speaking with discretion.

From this definition it may be gathered, that a man must either speak or be silent, and not neither and both. For when a man is silent, it signifies the absence of a power, but when a man speaks, it signifies the presence of a power.

But in a word, the virtue of speaking, and the virtue of silence, are as the two sides of the same truth: and they both are the same thing, that is to say, the truth; and in the truth itself, are found both the power and the virtue of speaking, and the power and virtue of silence. For to speak truthfully and to be silent in truth, are the same as speaking and being silent in the truth. And in speaking and being silent in truth, is found <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain
As our senses are strengthened, and our understanding enlarged, so the power of the soul is increased, and her endurance is extended, even to sufferings and pains, both outward and inward.
The end of all suffering, whether of mind, body, or sense, is either death, or a state of complete tranquility. Death is an end, that is, a true and true end, whereby all that is to be done, is done, and all that can be said, is said. In death, is also an end of all pains, and sufferings; and there is nothing more, that can be done. In death, all is finished, and done. And so, to live and die is one and the same, in the same sense, that the end of life, and the end of death, is one and the same. For as for the soul, in the same way as for the body, death is the natural end.
And even to the pains of the soul, if they be true pains, that is, a true pain, are added, that which is true comfort, that is, a true comfort: For it is impossible, that anything should be, without some natural and natural order, as in all natural things. And <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life
And in the same place of that which is called a man, it must be confessed that it is indeed short. For how much is it which is called a man, that he will not die? That is, how much of the man is in man, that it will not be cut off and taken away by death? The life of man is indeed but a span of time, and is a very short span: for how can the life of man be longer than the span of a reed. And in so long a time what is man to do? But then what can it be to man, to do and to act, if that life which he hath of time, doth not endure, but is cut short?
## Chapter 1
In the first age of the world, man was not at all, or only very little: and of that which he had, it was all short and fleeting; and not at all long and lasting, and of that which it was, it was all one. But in that age there was a kind of matter and substance: for a body of that kind, which is called flesh, and that flesh, which is called blood, did exist. And then that which was called a soul, did begin to exist <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger, the first consideration is that no one should ever be angry with a man who is angry. For if anger be a thing to be ashamed of, it is better that the man should be angry than that any other should be angry with him; and better that he should be angry in his heart, than that he should openly show his anger; because it is the more offensive to be angry in one's heart than openly and manifestly angry. For in this manner he can still keep his anger secret, and not offend against the common order, so as that it may not seem as though any one of us is a violent and angry man; whereas, if he should openly show his anger, it would seem as though he had lost his self-command, and could no more manage his anger, than a wild animal could.
This may be so; and it may also be so, that if a man is angry, he should be angry, and yet not be ashamed of his anger; and so it may be that if a man is angry with a man, and that man is angry, neither of them should be ashamed of their anger; and it may also be so, that neither of them should be angry with a man; and yet he should not be ashamed of his <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death
How to face death is a topic that has puzzled and disturbed people for centuries. Death has been a universal experience, common to all, and it is the natural fate that awaits all who live. As a matter of fact, death is not so much the end of life as it is the beginning of a new life, to be sure in a different sphere, but in another, as the Bible teaches us in the 6th book of Enoch, the 50th verse of Job, and the 7th book of Ezechiel, the 26th and 27th verses.

Death is to the soul that which the law of nature is to the body: and as the soul is a more excellent, more noble, and more reasonable substance, the soul's death is a more excellent, noble, and reasonable death. For when the soul is dead, it is no longer subject to corruption; it is no longer subject to sorrow, pain, or terror; it is no longer subject to the passions that do offend against reason and nature: but as it is freed from all those things that can offend, it is no longer subject to the same rules and laws of nature: but is governed by the law of God, and of reason itself, that is <END>

In all worldly matters, the only true wisdom is, not to seek, not to covet, not to desire; not to buy, not to sell; not to hire, nor be hired; not to do anything that thou mayest be grieved or vexed about, in all thy life. He that is wise and discreet, is ever content with such a state and condition of affairs.

A man who is wise and discreet, is not easily displeased, nor easily vexed at anything: for he is always disposed to see the good and proper part in all things, and to take that alone into consideration, which is agreeable unto reason.

As to what may be the true reason and cause of any thing, a wise and discreet man is not easily deterred, neither by any temptation, nor any fear, nor any difficulty, nor any difficulty that can befall him. For what is that which shall hinder him to find out, as a true and faithful man <END>

This is the true interpretation of the saying, that we should not suffer a man to speak ill of our neighbor, nor to say that we do speak ill of any man's neighbor; but to say that we do speak ill of a certain neighbor.

If the people of the world, and of the Church, had in them such an understanding and knowledge, as they now have of the true and proper meaning of these sayings, and the true nature of a neighbor, and the true nature of a man, they would not need any other rules and directions for their conversation, but would be contented to follow the rules and directions, which they already have.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless and the value lies in the personal relationship.
We must look upon all those that do deserve to be admired as among ourselves and to make them welcome: And though some should be able, and others not, we should use all due respect unto all of them: For there is nothing more strange and absurd than that those that do most deserve respect, should by their own pride and want of modesty be most offensive unto others.

Let every man take care of his own estate, and do as his place and duty requireth: For there is nothing in the world so vile, and so contemptible, as to do as others, and not as himself.

But to do the will of others is no small matter, but a matter of great import, and of a high degree: For though all things in themselves may seem indifferent, yet is it very difficult and hard, not only for ordinary men, but even for those that are most excellent and worthy to be admired: But those that are truly worthy and excellent, to be truly admired and praised, are those that have the ability and faculty to do the will of others. To do the will of others is a thing that is almost impossible, but that is only an illusion and deception to those that do not know how to do <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace and rest in the Lord.
(1 Peter 3:11.)
The world is full of many distractions and temptations: and, as for many, there is also in them the power to work, either against or against their will; and so there is also much occasion to desire to be free from the world. For it is a world that is full of unrighteousness, and that doth contain a great many things which are not acceptable unto God. As for them that desire to be free, they should desire the freedom of the Spirit, and the freedom of the will, that is, of God's will. The freedom of the Spirit, is the freedom from sin, and the power of the Spirit; which is a new creation in Christ, and that in which all that is either holy or good, or just, or true, or fair, and beautiful, doth consist.

To seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness, is also a kind of rest; and one that is more solid and more certain, than any that can be had of this world. It is not only a matter of rest, but of rest in the truest sense of the word, but also of true rest; a rest from the trials and assaults of the world <END>

Of the two kinds of times, absolute and relative, the absolute is that, which is, of itself, a time, without any relation to anything else, and without any regard unto that, which it doth depend upon. The relative is, that, which is, of itself, nothing but a relation of the one thing, to the other; as as when one time is said to be a time of another; or a time of one place, or place of one thing: which relation of a thing, to a thing, doth not depend upon the thing itself, but only upon its relation unto another.

Now that the soul is well taken care of, and its proper office performed, as it is commanded, and which is to make a proper sacrifice to the true God, and to bring all things to the worship of that God, then only the body may be taken care of, and set in order. For that which is chief and principal, is not the body, nor the mind; but God; and those things which are necessary to the worship of God, and to the carrying out of his commands. The body is to be set in order, by such things as are necessary to that end, as the cleanliness of the flesh, and the purity of the blood; the health of the lungs, the health of the heart; the health of the liver, the health of the gall-billet, and so on. The soul is set in order by prayer, and meditation, and the reading of the Scriptures; by fasting, by almsgiving, and by charity. And of these things, it is necessary that the body be cleansed; that it be exercised and strengthened; that it be governed and ruled, by a true and godly disposition, and by such things as are proper to the body; and that it be put in such a state, that <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain: a key to understanding the human experience

The ability to endure pain is a fundamental aspect of the human experience. Whether physical or emotional, pain is a universal experience that affects people of all ages, cultures, and backgrounds. In this essay, we will explore the endurance of pain as a key to understanding the human experience.

Pain is a universal human experience that has been a part of human existence since the beginning of time. It is an inevitable part of life, and yet, it is often a source of suffering and distress. The ability to endure pain is a vital skill that allows individuals to cope with adversity and overcome challenges. It is a fundamental aspect of resilience, and is essential for maintaining physical and emotional well-being.

There are many different types of pain, and each has its own unique characteristics and implications. Physical pain is often associated with injuries or illnesses, and can be debilitating and debilitating. Emotional pain is often associated with mental health disorders such as depression or anxiety, and can be just as debilitating as physical pain. Both types of pain require a similar approach to management and coping.

The endurance of pain is not just about the individual's physical and emotional strength, but also about their mental toughness and resilience. The ability to withstand pain is a fundamental aspect of the human <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life: a philosophical meditation.
The world is so full of things, and so full of people, that if it were to stand still and not move, we could never make a step either, or the better to go, we could never know what the proper step or way of walking in this world is, by the motion of the other things, or by the motion of our own selves, or by the motion of our common earth, if we will call it so. But since we do move, or if not, so be it, that we may yet move and walk in the world, I would fain learn from them that do move and walk in it, how they do move and walk. But there are not enough of them to give us any good instruction. Therefore let us not think, that by some few, that do move and walk in this world, we cannot learn. For, as we look into the things which are already done, it may appear that there is no difficulty or difficulty at all, in doing any thing whatsoever. For we can make, if we will, a thousand and a thousand thousand things; we can do, if we will, a thousand and a thousand and thousand and a thousand and a thousand things; and the best thing, <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger. - If thou dost not keep thy mind still and quiet, how canst thou be satisfied? and how canst thou be satisfied with the rest of men? For what can a man do that will give satisfaction unto his soul? Is it not to love those who are dear unto thee? Is it not to love those who are dear unto thee, and to hate those who are hateful unto thee? Is it not to love those who are hateful unto thee, and to hate those who are hateful unto thee? For how can any man be contented, except he do love those who are hateful unto him? And how can any man be contented, unless he doth hate those who are hateful unto him? For every man is a stranger unto his fellow; and therefore it is reasonable that every man should be a stranger unto every other man. But this thou must be satisfied with, that thou mayest love thyself, and thyself only. Thou must love thyself; but not as thou lovest others. Thou must be contented; but not with the contentment of others. Thou must not hate, but thou must not be hated. Thou must love, but thou must not be hated.

And first of all, that of all the things which the multitude of men may be either desirous of, or sensible of, this should be the first; that their appetites may not lead them astray, and that their knowledge, that of the world and of the universe, may not be false.
The multitude of the people are not apt to be contented, either in their own particular interests, or in those of the public.
Therefore, a king who is skilled in the affairs of the world, ought to be very careful in the administration of his government.
For a king ought to be as much the servant of the common good, as he is of his own particular interests; and of the common good, he ought to be the best of servants.

<BEGIN> On logic and reason; and that these are the things most properly subject to reason. For what can be better than that all those things should be done, which the mind is capable of, and which are consonant to the law of nature? For nature, is the rule and measure of all things. And, as we have a natural faculty for speaking, reading, and understanding; so also have we a natural faculty, for observing and remembering.
That all the things that happen, are either according to nature, or contrary to nature; and that it is not lawful to say, that anything that happens, is neither according to nature nor contrary to nature. For nature is the law of all things: and to say, that a thing is neither natural, nor unnatural, is to contradict the law of nature: and so, to speak falsely, and deceitfully. For all the things that happen, are either natural, or unnatural. And yet, in the end of all things, there must be some natural effect, and natural issue. And this, that every man is natural, and not unnatural, it must be proved, and that by reason.
Now, it seems unto me, that all men may reasonably conclude, that those things, which are natural to them, are according to nature <END>

And, because the laws are not the only law, but the laws of the laws: and because, in the laws of the laws, is also contained a law of justice, and a law of equity, and a law of equity of the equity: and, because, it is not every one that doth understand the meaning and signification of the laws of the law; and it is not every one that doth understand the nature and signification of justice; and it not every one that doth understand the nature and signification of equity: therefore is it also to be noted, that the ordinary actions of men in a commonwealth, are not every one of them honest, or just, or equitable.

When you’re a child, you look up to your parents. But as you grow older, you begin to question their motives. Why did they make so many sacrifices? What was the point? As for you, it's not that easy.

The point is, you're not doing it for anyone else. You're not doing it for your parents, for your friends, for your fans. You're not doing it for anyone else. You're doing it for yourself. You're doing it because you want to. You're doing it because it's what you love. But people look up to you, so you feel obligated to do it. They need you. They need your inspiration.

In God is that true peace, that doth truly satisfy the soul. And this is the peace, that doth consist in the inwardly pleasing and acceptable nature of the Lord. It is that which is said to be "a wellspring of the water of life;" that doth quench the thirst of the soul; and that doth satisfy and delight the imagination. That which is called "a fountain of waters" in the Psalmist, that doth continually flow from heaven unto heaven. That which is said of God, "that He doth make all things to work together in harmony," that is, that He doth unite all things in love and concord. And that is that true peace which is found in the love of Christ. For without this love of Christ, it is not possible, but we should be filled with sorrow and discontentment.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is the opposite of avarice. For when the tongue is silent, the hand cannot be avaricious, for it cannot go about doing any ill deeds. The tongue, being silent, is the hand’s master; and the hand, being silent, is the tongue’s. Hence, the virtues of the mind are the virtues of the lips. If the lips are silent, the heart is silent. For if the lips, which are the outward instruments of speech, be silent, then must also be the heart, which is the inward instrument of speech. The heart is the master of the lips, and the lips are the servants of the heart. When the heart is silent, the lips are also silent; and when the lips are silent, the heart is also silent. It is for this reason that, in the beginning, when God created the world, He created both man and woman of the same flesh; so that man might be the servant of the woman, and the woman the servant of man; and that they might be of the same silence. For they that are the masters of the silence of others, have a certain superiority over them; and those that are servants of the silence of others, have a certain inferiority over them.

By the same, the time that is not occupied by any one of the ordinary pursuits of life, is of no use, but is to be accounted as lost. What doth happen, or what happeneth, of the time of men that is not occupied with the things that men are accustomed to do?
The common notion, that we must all die, is nothing to us: for all the same that we should live, and not be dead: for all the same that we should live, and be not dead. What therefore doth happen, or what happeneth of that time, is the thing of consideration.

(c) A man cannot be angry, and be just; they are mutually exclusive. (d) The wrath of a king, and the anger of a subject, must be of a very different kind.

It is possible that one may sometimes see or imagine, and that again to see or imagine, that some other and other universe, or other way of operation, has existed, or exists, or shall exist. This is not to be taken to be an opinion either of the philosophers, or the poets; for those opinions are altogether different. The philosophers think it to be one and one only; that one and only universe doth exist, or must necessarily exist, and that it must be one that can have all other things as its parts and elements, as it may be thought: for all things are one, and that one is one universe only; as it were a single body, having one substance and one nature. For as every part that is taken away from the universe, is taken away from the very substance and essence of that universe, so also must the very substance and essence itself be taken away from the universe itself; for that which is taken away, is that which it is, and that which it is, is that which it taketh away. Therefore also there is no other and other universe: for they are all one and the same, and it is not possible but that there should be but one universe; because in <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death: A spiritual perspective

Death is the natural end of every individual, and it is the very nature of a man to die. To shun death, is not only impossible, but also utterly absurd; and yet it is that we commonly do. We think that to live is to shun death. And here again we do err: because the very thing of which death is, to die, is the very thing which life is: and they cannot be separated, because they are inseparable. Death, therefore, is not the end of life, but the end of death; that is to say, life is the very thing of which death is the end, and which itself doth end in death.

The question how to face death is to know the nature of death; and how death is the very end of death, how the end of death is the beginning of life, how the end of life is the beginning of death, and how both are one and the same: which is but a circle; or a true and proper definition of the one.

And thus we are to understand, that death, when once the proper end and beginning of life, is the very cause of life; and that the end of death, is the very beginning of death.

by Plato.
Plato was born in Athens in 427 BC, died in 347 BC. The Greek text was in dactylic hexameter (six feet of dactylic meter). Plato's dialogue on logic and reason: the dialogue of Protagoras and Socrates, contains two parts: (1) A discourse on reason and its nature, and (2) An argument or disputation, between Protagoras and Socrates, on the matter of reason and its application, in the following terms:-- 'What is reason? Is it not the power which we call our mind?' 'And what is our mind? Is not it our soul?' 'And what is our soul? Is not it the same with that which we call our self?' (Crito, Crito, Bk. 2) The only thing we know, is that our knowledge and understanding are such that we can have no true opinion. For they are but such as our soul is, which we have already explained; and which in truth are but as a drop in an ocean, and an atom of dust in the whole world, or a single hair, or an arrow shot into the air; or <END>

In this manner it is, that those that are in the right, that which is their right they do; and in the same manner it is with them, that which they have of their right, they do. For they do not take anything that is not their right, as to the others who are in the wrong, it is as a matter of right. They do as much to those, as those do to them.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless. What do people really want?

## Step 1: Recognize that fame is a superficial concept
Fame is often associated with success, but it is also fleeting and ephemeral. A person who is famous today may not be remembered in a few years.

## Step 2: Understand that true fulfillment comes from within
People may crave fame because they are seeking validation and a sense of importance. However, true fulfillment and happiness come from within. They are derived from personal growth, meaningful relationships, and contributing to society in a positive way.

## Step 3: Identify the root of human desire
The root of human desire is not for external validation but for personal growth, love, connection, and contribution. These desires are not fulfilled by mere fame or popularity.

## Step 4: Conclude that fame is not the key to happiness
Given that fame is fleeting and that true fulfillment and happiness come from within, it is clear that fame is not the key to happiness.

<BEGIN> On finding peace, there is also a change of opinion; and as the mind is not yet sufficiently opened, it is necessary, as it were, that some new and unusual impression be applied unto it, in order to set it right. And what is a new impression, if not the application of an argument? (This is an opinion of Cicero.) For argument is the application of reason unto anything that is in question.

But now, we have in view, not arguments only, but also signs and appearances. For what is the argument of the eyes, or of the ears? This is what is called a sign, and a sign of the same kind. For signs are those things that have a relation unto some argument or reason. For so it is also with colours, as some say, and with sounds, as some others; for these also are signs, and signs of some kind. But signs are not arguments, for they do not have any real being, they are not that which is of themselves, and that which is of itself, is an argument; and the signs are only a mere relation unto some argument.

The art of dealing with anger and passion, is one that requires great industry and pains; and if we speak of it properly, it is a part of the general art of dealing with those passions. For as there is nothing in this world so excellent and beautiful, as a well regulated understanding, and a temperate and reasonable disposition: so is there nothing more vexing and troublesome, than a passion of anger and rage, which, when it is not reformed and governed, is the cause of many evils and misfortunes. For it is a passion, that doth disturb the tranquillity and peace of our mind; and that doth make our bodies subject to many diseases, and the cause of many disorders. Hence therefore it is necessary, that we should deal with anger and passion, in a certain and proper way.

First then we should understand what it is to be angry. For this is a common matter, and that of all men is most familiar. For so it is, that when we hear of any man's anger, we say it is a matter of no concernment, and not of much matter either, either because of their good and gentle nature, or their bad and furious nature.

But, if they are true, then is that which is truly said of them, also true: as it is also of any other things that are truly said of them.

We should know that death is not a cruel tyrant, but rather a natural and necessary thing, and that it is not to be feared and dreaded. Secondly, we should not be afraid of the future and should not be troubled by the fear of the future. Thirdly, we should be content with what God hath appointed for us, and should not be disturbed and perplexed by the affairs of this life. Fourthly, we should not be affected by the opinions and judgments of other men, and should not be afraid of their censure and blame. Fifthly, we should not be troubled by the passions and desires that beset us. And lastly, we should not be afraid of the future, and we should not be troubled by the present, for the present is but a moment, and the future is but a dream, and the past is <END>

The duty of a leader is to keep himself in a temper of grace, and in a readiness to obey God's word. - John Bunyan

This quote by John Bunyan emphasizes the importance of a leader's character. To keep oneself in a temper of grace is to cultivate a spirit that is pleasing to God, characterized by humility, compassion, and kindness. Being in a readiness to obey God's word is a commitment to live according to His will, following His commandments and respecting His authority. By striving for a life of grace and obedience, a leader demonstrates their respect for God and their responsibility to Him. <END>

From this place, we are to understand, that reason or understanding is not a matter of the flesh; nor a mere sense or imagination; but of the intellect, or that part of the mind wherein the understanding doth reside, which is properly called reason.

To use reason or to reason; is not a matter of mere thought or imagination, but of a natural faculty and disposition of the mind, wherein all that is rationally and naturally conceived, is conceived and perceived; which is properly called understanding. And truly, it is no more than natural and proper for all rational creatures, to understand the nature of things. But what is to be understood, is not a thing of opinion, but of reason.

What can be done, cannot be done. What can be done, is to be done. And we are to look, not so much on the particular actions, as on the general design.
As I said in another place, to look upon a man as he is, not so much as what he doeth, is to look upon him as if he were dead. But as he is, is to look upon him as if he were alive; for there is difference. This difference, as I said, is the difference of the soul and the body.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
By Alain de Botton, published on February 4, 2023, in The Times.

What is the purpose of a life well lived? One answer is to create the world we wish to leave behind. Another answer is to become a part of the world, so that we may be found to have added to it in some meaningful way. This latter is the way we find the meaning of our lives. And so we would have it, that it would be more profitable and useful for us to have been a part of this world. For to have been a part of it is that which is truly beautiful and truly good.

Now, let us speak of the purpose of the world itself. And here it must be noted, that it is the same as that of all the world of things, or rather that of one, as far as concerns the order of nature; for the universe itself is a world, as well as all other things. Now, the proper purpose of the world is to be a world, and to be in a world, as well as all other things. The world being a world, it must by its very nature have a purpose. And that purpose is that of a world, as we have spoken, namely to be a world <END>

A. N. Neill, A.D. 1692.
That are not capable of such reason as he, is the very same thing that makes his passage the more difficult. But that is to be looked upon as an inauspi
cious accident. For though it be hard for him that is in such a situation, to make any further progress in his knowledge, yet that is not to be imputed to him; for it was his own fault, that he did not seek out a proper place, to dwell in, where he might not be disturbed. The more a man is used to, and the more accustomed he is, to his own condition; the more is he able, to bear any thing, and to endure anything. That is a very happy condition indeed. For the reason of this is, that the mind, in such a state, is not subject to any new impressions or appearances, which it has not been accustomed to. This is that, which makes the passage of time, to be so hard and difficult. But if one do but follow, the example of the rest of mankind, to keep themselves to themselves; that is, to keep themselves in that same state, and condition, wherein they are used to <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence.
A certain good man, in the time of his death, began to think of the state of the world. He considered that it was filled with such a multitude of evil deeds and wicked actions; that a man who should have a heart full of love, a pure heart, a compassionate mind, and a tender and pitiful spirit, would scarce be able to bear and endure that world: Forsooth, then, he had no desire to live longer, than for the space of a month or two: For if such a world should continue, he could hardly have patience to live one day, if so be that he should see the end of such an evil world.

Hence it was that this good man thought, that it was not convenient to be in such a world, but that it was better to be out of this world. For he thought, that he could not bear with the multitude of evil deeds and wicked actions; neither could he bear the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. For the world was full of wickedness and lechery, and a great part of men were wicked, and full of malice. And they that did anything that was good and just, they were few. But the contrary was, the multitude of the wicked was <END>

Now, when any man, from some wicked action, hath fallen into some miserable condition; either by a voluntary act, or by some involuntary action, and for a time hath been oppressed and tyrannized over. If he is, for some time, able to endure, and to bear patiently all that he suffereth, so as that he doth not break and part: but if he, being in such a condition, can endure it; and patiently suffer it; that is a true mark of his patience and endurance. Now, in this respect, that man, whose soul is true and holy, is very much in the likeness of God. For what is God, but a spirit of patience and endurance? What is a man, but a spirit of a lower nature, and not much better? But yet, that which is truly and properly divine, is not the same, with that which is not truly and properly divine; but that, and that, are as much as they can be, like unto one another. (ch. 27)_

1. Recognize the source of the anger and resentment: It is essential to identify the reason or source of the anger and resentment. What is it that is causing the anger and resentment? Is it due to a perceived injustice, or is it a personal issue? Once the source of the anger and resentment is identified, one can start to work on resolving the issue and letting go of the negative feelings. 2. Acknowledge and accept: Acknowledge the anger and resentment, and accept that it is a part of yourself. Don’t try to suppress or deny it. Instead, accept it as a normal and natural response to a situation. 3. Let go of the negative feelings: Once the anger and resentment are acknowledged and accepted, let go of them. Release the negative feelings and emotions from your body and mind. Let go of the anger and resentment, and focus on moving forward. 4. Practice forgiveness: Forgiveness is an essential step towards healing and moving on. Forgiveness is not about forgetting or condoning, but about releasing the negative emotions associated with the incident. Practice forgiveness towards yourself, others, and the situation. 5. <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death
To face death is not to be afraid of it. If thou hast truly apprehended the nature of death, thou shalt not be afraid. The apprehension of death is the cause of fear, but if thou hast truly known its true nature, that it is not so much an end as a beginning. It is but a transition to another life, and a change into another kind of life, that of immortality; and yet that life is no other, but the life of God. Then it is true, that death is not so much an end, as a beginning. It is but the entrance of a new life, and a new kingdom, of which it is the entrance. And if this entrance, be truly apprehended, it will not be a cause of fear, but a cause of joy.
What then is death? Death is nothing but a change, and a transition from one state of life to another, and then into another kind of life, of immortality; and yet is that life no other, but the life of God. It is not an end, but a beginning. It is not an exit, but an entry. It is not a destruction, but a creation. It is not a dissolution, but a new composition.

On the behavior of others in a world of moral indifference: the case of the Stoics. In the Stoic world, individuals are not held accountable to the same moral standards as others, but to their own reason, and their own character. In the Stoic view, individuals are not judged according to external appearance, but according to their moral conduct. But even the Stoic philosophers themselves did not entirely agree in this view. Some of the Stoics held that the universe is a unity, and that all things are interconnected in the universe. Others held that the universe is a mere machine, devoid of any essential unity. In the Stoic view, the universe is governed by reason, or rather by the natural reason of the universe, which is the same as the reason of the universe in the sense that it is the same as the natural reason of the universe. But even this is not a subject of disagreement among the Stoics.

In this world, fame is nothing. And no human is worthy to have it.

And what is good? This is to do well to another, and to do what is right and just. To do well to another is a doing well unto him, that shall reward him according to his merit; and that is a doing well unto a man, because a man is a reasonable creature, and a rational soul; and that is a doing well unto a man, that is a man of honour. And what is honourable? Honour is such a doing, as doth well to a man’s honour. Honour is a thing that is common to all men. And if it were otherwise, the world were a very strange and uncouth place.

He must, as the good physician, be contented to attend unto the parts, and not the whole; to make use of the remedies which are proper to each, and not to all. And to be able to bear the inconvenience and vexation of things that happen, not with the body, but with the mind, which are those that trouble us. He that is able to endure, that is able to bear the inconveniences and vexations of life, and is contented with that which is, that he is well grounded in the true nature of things, and that he hath a true knowledge of his own soul; for the things of the world are nothing: that and no more is the soul of man; and it is the chief part of man's knowledge, to understand the true nature of the soul.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence. What doth it signifie, to be silent?

It signifieth to be soberly, and quietly disposed in all things; not to say anything, when it is not absolutely necessary; not to stirre up, or to be disturbed by anything that doth happen in the world, or that any one doth say or do: not to be garrulous, or talkative; not to be moved with the opinions of others, nor with the opinions of them selves; and to be satisfied in the midst of a tempest.

This silence is of a spiritual kind; it is the silence of the mind; it is the silence of the heart. The flesh is subject to a natural and necessary noise; as is the motion of all living creatures; and as is the common course of things in the world; but the mind and the heart, are subject to a natural and necessary quiet. And therefore, this silence of the heart, is the proper subject of our contemplation, and meditation.

It is true, that men are very much in love with anger. They are so much enamoured of the passion, that they are willing to buy their lives, to gain an hour's pleasure. But to love anger, is not the same with loving it to be cured.

When once a man is in a fit of the vapours, he is in a very sad and woeful condition; and so indeed is his life; for when a man is in the vapours, he is not himself. He is a stranger to his own mind, and to the understanding of himself, and to the reason of himself.

Now this fit of vapours, which we commonly call anger, is not an accident to men. It is not a thing that doth happen unto men. But it is a thing that doth happen unto some men; but not unto every man; and in every case, it is a very sad and woeful thing. But if it happen unto a wise and reasonable man, it is a sign and a symptom, that he doth not now keep himself in the right, and in the usual course of his reason. If it happen unto a <END>

When facing death, there are many thoughts and emotions, which make us feel overwhelmed. Death can make us feel a little hopeless, and unsure of what to do.
In this regard, the following are some of the things we can do when facing death, and ending suffering:
Be grateful to God. When we die, our soul will go back to God and our Lord and Master, and in His presence, He will not be grieved by our sins. All of us will be free from suffering. Our soul will be happy and free. Our soul will be in His presence, and all will be well. If we have done well, all will be well.
Toil not against death, for death is not against us; and it will not take us by surprise; but it will come to us, in good time. It is like the summer. It is not against the trees and the leaves to fall, but they themselves, with all their leaves and fruits, fall before the autumn. They are not angry or grieved. It is in the same way with our bodies, and our souls. They will not be angry or grieved, because death is their nature. It is not against them to die.

The very first thing that the mind is to know and understand is that, though we are all subject to time, and that time passes upon us, and doth inconstant and ever-changing cause, as well as motion, doth continue, yet our lives are all bound by it, and that in it our very existence, is bound. That it doth, that it doth, and that it doth; that is that it is true. So that if it were false, that is if time were false, and all things subject unto it, were false too, then all things were false; but if it were true, that is if all things subject unto time, were true too; then all things, must be true.
All things subject unto time, are those things which are not eternal, but finite, or limited, in the use of that time, as that they will pass and expire in that time, and be no more. And of all the finite and limited, there are two kinds. The one, are those things which have a natural expiration, or coming to pass, as that they will all pass, and be no more, if they have not some other end or effect; that is, if they have a natural time, <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain, that which is able to bear patiently. — Chaucer.
1. In the ancient times, the Jews called the body of Christ, "The tabernacle of God, wherein he hath put his glory." Matt. xvi. 17. But now, how it is, that Christ is called the tabernacle, is according to the New Testament, as we shall see.
2. Now it is plain, that this word tabernacle, did originally refer unto some place where people did congregate. For "a tabernacle" was a thing, wherein people did gather and meet together.
3. This, and that, is the general nature of a word. That is, it is to signify some place, wherein they did meet together, and did gather themselves there.
4. Wherein doth he dwell? Doth he dwell in the clouds? or doth he dwell in the firmament? No, but in a house, wherein he dwelt, and was known, and was adored by all. (Hosea, i. 2.) It is written in the Psalm, that God dwelt in the tabernacle, or in the house of David, or in the temple, as the occasion was. <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life and its inevitability
When is a man of understanding of life? How often hath that blessed man of the Hebrews, the writer of the books of the Old Testament, spoken of that very same thing, as one that had been long, long time since dead? In the very midst of his conversation he speaks of a time that hath long ago passed off. This is indeed the true character of a man of understanding: to live and to speak as if he were already dead.
But how short is life? It is true that there is in all men a certain natural inclination to think well of things, and to persuade themselves of things which they do not truly believe. But that which is to be believed is that very same which is to be done: and that which is to be done is not another thing from the very same thing which is to be believed. There is in all men that same natural inclination, which I have already said to be true. And because it is true, I will speak of it, in order that it may be more clearly understood; because it is to be understood, it is to be believed. For the thing that is to be believed is the very same as that thing which is to be done. For that which is to be <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger. To my brother, or friend, when thou art angry.

Take heed, dear brother, that thou do not be angry, lest it consume thee: for anger is a consuming fire, that doth eat away, and destroys all that is dear unto thee. Yea, and it is a very mischievous, and false, and crafty thing, that doth beguile the mind, and doth deceive the eye, and doth blind the understanding.

Now therefore, if thou art angry, take this: that thou mayest be contented, that thou art not of them that are angry; for it is a thing most unreasonable and unworthy in a man to be angry, and to rage and swear. And as thou takest this contentment, be sure also, to use no angry words, and to say nothing that may offend. For it is not enough to be contented, that we are not angry; but it is necessary, also, to be quiet, and still, and composed, both in word, and deed.

We have considered that which is manifest, and the proper motions of the celestial spheres, and their revolutions. Now we must speak of the things that are invisible. Let us, therefore, go back to the beginning of all things; and ask whence these things proceeded. We are all accustomed to suppose, that there was once a beginning, out of which the universe was brought forth: and that as such a beginning, so the universe itself was created. This is the general opinion of men.
We will not therefore speak of anything else, but of this universe itself. What, therefore, is its proper nature and its proper form; let that be, and we will go on: What then is this universe? That we should speak of first: what then is this universe, that there might be anything in it; and what then is this universe, that there might be any universe at all?
Let us not therefore suppose, that it was brought forth by any means; but rather let us suppose, that it was itself always; and that it was always as it is now. For as for what it was before, as for what there was before it; we are not able to speak anything of that. For how many things are there, that there <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death as a Christian. As a Christian, we do not need to be afraid of death, because he that dies for Christ is in heaven and that is his real and true happiness and the beginning of eternal life. He that doth live a good life, but doth not die for Christ, doth not live a true and holy life. He that doth live a good life, but doth not die for Christ, must either die of his own sin, or must he live, and yet die: for in the latter case, it is clear that his life was not a true and holy life. For in the life and death of Christ, is the true pattern and example, and he that doth follow it, doth follow the true pattern and example of the life and death of Christ. And he that doth not, is not in Christ: For unto him that doth obey Christ, unto whom Christ doth command and say unto him, What thou hast not, give unto the poor, that is my mother and my mother and my mother. unto whom, it is clear, that all men should obey, but unto whom also, all men should fear, as unto unto their mother.

<BEGIN> On the behavior of others, we can often tell whether they are likely to do well, or ill, without our knowing any other thing about them: but in their internal constitution, or true nature, and that which is truly the nature of their mind and spirit, we must not be so sure of any certain judgment. For, if some are of a better and more rational kind, as they themselves must be, they may yet in many ways be corrupted and ruined; as indeed are many that are not so rational and good. And the corruption and ruin, if it be a true corruption and ruin, do not depend on any other thing, but only on the power of that corrupter which doth act upon it. But, if that corrupter be a false corrupter, and that which doth act upon it, not truly corrupt and corrupting, but rather preserving, strengthening, and good; then is it not a true and certain corruption and ruin.
So, when we are at a loss, and in a dilemma, about some thing that is in dispute, or about the nature of some one thing: how long and how narrowly must we consider the matter: that which doth happen, to be true and certain, if it be possible: so that when the matter is fully considered <END>

A famous person can never truly be famous. Only someone who is completely unknown can ever be truly unknown. Famous people are simply unknown. They are famous by name only and they know nothing of the meaning of the word. They are completely unaware of the fact that they are only famous, for their names is all they have to show for their efforts, and it is their name only that they remember. They remember nothing else. They forget all the efforts that they have made to gain their fame. They forget all the sacrifices and the hardships that they have endured in order to become famous. They forget all their efforts and all their sacrifices. They remember nothing else. They remember nothing but their own fame. And that is their all. And they know nothing of it. They are completely ignorant of the fact that their fame is not true fame, but only a matter of fame and notoriety. They know not what true fame is.

<BEGIN> On finding peace and happiness. It is the common property of the human race to be discontented, to be pining after something that is impossible: and this is natural: for a man cannot help but desire something, and in so doing to be at peace. But they that are wiser and more prudent, they have found out a remedy against discontentment; for it is a common cause of all sorts of evils; it is the root of all disorders, and the beginning of all miseries: and therefore those that seek a general happiness, seek for that also, and are willing to go through with the world in order, to find out and attain it.
To find peace and happiness, thou must first be satisfied and content with that, which thou hast in the world, and that which is provided for thee. A man may have a great estate, and yet be very miserable, or he may be poor and yet be very happy: and that is no wonder, for that is that which doth truly please and content. That which please thee and content thee, that alone is true happiness. (Matthew 20:22, 23; 1 Kings 19, 20; 2 Samuel 24, 13.) — A man is to seek peace and happiness <END>

That which hath no beginning, hath also no end. The race of mankind, which now hath begun and is now in its

its beginning, hath already in its end. And that which hath in its middle, hath in its beginning. That which is in its end, hath already in its middle. Thus doth it
go: all things begin in their end, and all things
end in their beginning. All things that have a beginning, and all things that have an end, must therefore be either created, or corrupted.
And such a being as that of a man, created and corrupted, can
any other being be? Of those that have not a beginning or an end, such is the being of a star, or any other such as are born of one another. But all things, whether created, or corrupted, or both, are governed by one common law, or principle, or order, that doth regulate and govern all things.

To speak unseemly and indecorously is the contrary of virtue. The manner of speaking, and the words themselves, do not only affect the person that speaks, but the minds of all who hear them; and those words or phrases, that are either offensive, or not suitable for the occasion, do oft times grieve those that hear them, and offend those that speak them.

It is also a sign of a true lover and a devoted servant of Christ, who is careful not to speak against his will, but to speak according to his will, and to speak that which is agreeable unto his heart; and in the way of praying, or speaking in the name of Christ, or with respect unto Christ, it is not enough to say the words and the words only, but those also are also necessary which are proper unto the matter: as in this sentence; “By my spirit, and in the name of my Son Jesus, I pray thee;” here there are three things necessary.

The same as in the case of Elijah; for he was borne by a chariot, to a place where he was to be eaten; and as in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ, he was borne by an angel, to the land of the Assyrians. If even the saints who are in heaven, were brought back by an angel to the world, it would be more consistent, that their souls should also be brought back by an angel. And in the case of the patriarchs; if they had been carried to the other world, as their souls had been, before, their bodies must have been brought back; for what is the use of an earthly life, and of a human body, if they were not carried back, after the departure of the soul? As for the case of Adam and Eve, the first parents; if they had been carried back, their bodies would have been brought back, <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life: the mind cannot possibly conceive any longer duration, and therefore can have no other notion of the time of life, than that it is short. The very reason of the shortness, and the nature of it, are the very reason and nature of a true life. If life be short, and only short; then this cannot be, but that true life, which, as already said, is not of time only, but of the mind, and that life, and life's time, cannot but be a little. (De Motu, ii. 19)

From the above passage, we can conclude that:

- The duration of life is very short. 
- It is short and only short. 
- Therefore, a true life is a little short. 

The passage can also be concluded as:

- The shortness and nature of life, as well as a true life, cannot but be a little short. 

The passage can also be concluded as:

- A true life is of a little and very short.

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe; a discourse, by way of dialogue, between the gods of the world, and the true gods of the universe. By Tho. Harrison.

## Step 1: Understand the context of the dialogue.
The dialogue is between gods of the world and the true gods of the universe, which Harrison refers to as "the gods of the universe." This implies a comparison between the gods that are worshipped by humans and the ultimate or divine reality.

## Step 2: Recognize the philosophical theme.
The dialogue appears to explore fundamental questions about the nature of the universe, including the existence and nature of the divine, the ultimate cause or principle of the universe, and the relationship between the world and the divine.

## Step 3: Analyze the nature of the divine in Harrison's dialogue.
Harrison's use of the term "true gods of the universe" suggests that the dialogue is an inquiry into the nature of the ultimate divine reality. This may involve discussions about the divine as the source of all being and existence, the nature of divine causality, and the relationship between the divine and the material universe.

## Step 4: Identify the nature of the universe as described by Harrison.

The essence of human nature is not its individuality, but its solidarity with other souls and with God. To contemplate the universe in all its relations to human life, is the true end and goal of philosophy, of poetry, and of religion. For that which is, and for what has been, and for what shall be, to contemplate in all its relations to human life, is that which is and should be the greatest wisdom and prudence.

Aristotle, Epictetus, and other Stoics, who did not object to death, but were able to die with joy and tranquility, were not only worthy of the highest praise and admiration, but they were the very essence of their generation, and the proper part of their age, which was distinguished for its piety, and its zeal for the public good.

The happiness of the world depends on the happiness of a single man, for one man is enough for the happiness of the whole world.

In the nature of a man, there is a desire of eternal life, which is the end and the greatest good of man.

The famous can say and do anything; they are as good as kings. But is this true? A great deal is made of their liberty to say and do anything; but what can they do? They can do nothing.

The first, and chiefest, of these is that of the universe, that is to say, the world, that is to say, man. Now as this world is subject to that which we call the passage of time, so is also this, the passage of time, subject to that of the world, and man. The world, as a body, is subject, and can be subject, of that which we call the passage of time. And a man, as a body, is subject, and can be subject, of that of which we call the passage of time.
If, therefore, any man shall think it a good and true thing, that the world should not be subject to the passage of time, neither the passage of time should be subject to the world; it is better to consider it in itself, and in itself it is true: for as long as the world doth exist, and the world doth exist, so long the passage of time doth exist, and so long the passage of time doth exist, so long the world doth exist; for that is, that as long as the world doth exist, so long it doth exist: and as long as the passage of time doth exist <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence.
The silence of the blessed is not only a sign of their purity, but also a source of their happiness, and a means of their comfort. In the blessed there is nothing but joy, nothing but contentment. Their minds are completely empty of all passions. They have no desire, no aversion, no fear, no love. They are free from all disturbances, and have a perfect peace.

But that their silence be not a silence of want of knowledge, but a silence of will, is to be understood. For it is not necessary for a man to be silent, and yet know the truth of all things. That may happen even to one who speaketh; for he may know the truth of things, and yet be unable to utter a word.

As for their being silent in the midst of all things, this also is a sign of their greatness and nobility of mind. For how can it be that men should speak and speak, and yet speak not out of a true and holy principle? Or how can it be that men should speak, and yet speak not of the truth, but of a false and vain imagination? They speak of truth and of falsehood. They speak of truth, and of a mere appearance.

This phrase occurs in the Book of Job, chapter 5, verse 9, as the title of a poem by David, which is quoted by the prophet Elihu in chapter 3, verse 9. Here, it is not as a title, but as a sentence; which is somewhat thus interpreted: If pain can endure, it can do nothing, for it is nothing but a continuance of pain. Thus then doth our life depend on pain; which if it can endure, can do nothing. It is a matter of great difficulty, and a thing that doth require a long consideration; how long pain doth continue. Some, in their time of affliction, do find a great comfort in their own endurance of pain; but many others are carried away by the violence of their sorrow, and are carried hence, before they can have much opportunity to consider upon the matter. It is a thing which should not be rashly committed to. (As in the Book of Ecclesiastes, chapter 1, verse 11, which is quoted by the apostle, in his First Epistle, to the Corinthians, chapter 7, verse 3.)

By way of conciliation, it may be observed, that it is the soul of man, and of all rational creatures, that is to be considered the object of death; the soul, the life of man, and the very thing of which death is the effect. For death is not the destroying of the body, but the removing of that which is in it; that is to say, of the soul. Therefore is it, that when the soul is dead, that is, is not; it is the soul, which is not, that is dead. And therefore also is it, that if the soul of any man, or of any rational creature, be destroyed; it is not that of another man, that is destroyed, that can be considered a thing that is done. For what is done, is done upon a soul that is already destroyed: as is the death of that very soul, which was destroyed the very first time that that soul was created; or that first soul, which was created in the beginning of time, and of all. And therefore that which is done, is done only upon that very soul, which is destroyed in all, or that which is created in all, or that very soul, <END>

Therefore, let him not be censured as a man of a bad temper, for he is a good man of a bad temper; and let him be commended as a man who properly tempereth his anger, for he is a good man.

<BEGIN> How to face death. Facing death is a difficult process. One must not try to be brave. No one is brave when it comes to death. If we are able to accept it and live life to the fullest then it will be easy for us to face the inevitable.
Accepting death as part of life is a great and noble thing. It is a universal law of nature that all men must die. In the Bible it is said that “to die is gain”. It means that to die is the gain of eternal life. To live is a great and precious gift, and to die is not a loss but a gain.
He who accepts death will also accept death itself. This is the only way to avoid anxiety and fear. And anxiety and fear is a great evil that we cannot do without.
No one has lived long enough. This is a fact that everyone must acknowledge. And everyone must also acknowledge that death is inevitable. To live is not a great thing, and to die is not a loss, if one has lived long enough to gain eternal life. This is the only true happiness.
Death is not a thing of fear, but it is the natural way of things. All things must come to an end, and death is the end of all things. When a tree falls <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is not to get his own way, but to enable others to get their own way. ... He has not so much power of governing his passions, as is commonly supposed.  He is, indeed, as much subject to the influences of his passions, as any other man; only he is not as much affected by them, as many others are; only he has a more natural and a more easy disposition to resist and to restrain them; and this, not for any natural superiority in him, but because he is so much accustomed to be governed by his reason, that his reason now does command him, and the command of his reason doth govern his passions.

<BEGIN> On logic and reason
By Sir Thomas Browne.

As he that hath seen, or shall see, a thousand wonders of the world, doth not thereupon conclude himself a wise man, because he hath seen the thousand wonders: no, but as he is wise, he shall see the thousand wonders.

When I consider, and ponder, what is the nature and essence of the world, and that it is infinite: I find myself in such a case, that I do desire to have more knowledge about it, and to have the truth, that I may be able to give a true account of it, and so to satisfy those that will hear me, and that they may not be deceived. And so, I do continue to seek after it, with all the industry, and diligence, that my age and condition will allow.

In so much as the things which are to come, are not yet come, and therefore they are not yet seen, neither heard, nor known. And in so much, as that they that are not yet come, are yet to be seen, and heard, and known. And in so much, as the things that are, are yet to be seen, and heard, and known.

<BEGIN> On the behavior of others, there is nothing so hard or intractable as it is commonly represented to be; and there is nothing so easy and obvious, as it is generally supposed to be. For, if they would but take their own parts, and understand themselves; they would easily know, when anything is true or false; and when any thing is right or wrong. But as they are not able, it is as well that they should not; for that would not only be a very dangerous thing, but very absurd, and ridiculous, that the understanding of others should be in their own power, and not in their own power that of others. For, if the understanding of others were in their power, they could, as they pleased, put them into any error or absurdity whatsoever. They could, if they would, make any one of their own, to be the very oracle of the world. They could, if they pleased, make any one of their own, to be the very king of kings. They could, if they pleased, make any one of their own, to be the very author of all that is good, and all that is evil. And they would, as they pleased, make all things as they pleased; and as they pleased, they would change all <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless in a world that needs wisdom.
Today, you might find that someone you know is trying to impress you with a new pair of clothes or a fancy new gadget. Perhaps someone you meet might brag about their new car or their high salary, and they're asking you to join in on the boasting. The irony is that such people are probably the least impressed with such things themselves. For all their bravado, they are probably more concerned with being admired by others than with being admired by themselves. But as I always say, "A true philosopher is a true man. For the former, wisdom is his highest end, and his life the perfection of his wisdom; the latter, merely a mask and a disguise." For it is in the pursuit of wisdom that true happiness and satisfaction of one's soul are to be found. And such happiness can only be found in a life of true virtue. The former is a mere fleeting pleasure, an empty pomp. The latter is a true and solid happiness, a real happiness. And that happiness is not to be found by those who are merely vain and empty-minded. But by those who, with true wisdom and virtue, are filled and satisfied with their own proper ends and occupations. For it is in the proper end of each man's <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace
In all that is; for in all there is peace; and that for ever. It is as with the soul that is dead: the body is not dead. And it is as the dead that are alive, that are dead. For all the body is not dead, and that is not dead: and it is not so with the body that is not dead, that is dead. This is the nature of the universe.

And this is the nature of the soul. That in all things there is peace: that for ever is. And as for the rest, they are not but as the images and pictures of those things; as the impression or writing of the hand of the painter upon a canvas. As it were, the soul is a painter, that doth paint all things. But the canvas is but a canvas. And the colours and the figures that doth paint are but colours and figures. So it is also with the world: for so is it with all things. For all things are but the images and pictures of those things. But the things themselves are not so. And therefore it is that men may say that the world is not so, nor is it so. For all is but appearance, and that is all. But that is not <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is very pleasing, because it is not only more orderly than the other virtues, but it is also more divine. For when a man doth observe silence, it is like a mirror, in which the beauty of God doth appear, and is shewn to us. And that it is not merely a figure, that this virtue is of God, but a true and real one, we have our daily conversation, to tell us and make known, that the virtues of God, are in themselves divine. For to do good is a true sign of the grace of God. And that he is gracious, that he is willing that his grace may be in us. And that is his grace, to make us gracious unto others, and to do good unto them. And that he doth give us grace, unto do good unto others, is the same as saying that he doth give us grace to keep silence.
In this case, however, it is necessary to note that the silence which is spoken of in this context is not the complete silence, where the mind and thoughts are entirely silent, and the soul and body are inactive. For this complete silence is not common, and it is not to be wished, nor desired to be had; for if the soul and <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain and difficulty
I would rather endure one thousand times of pain and difficulty, and one hundred times of hardship and difficulty, than one day of pleasure and delight without any need or occasion. For there is no good thing that can happen to man, without some evil also. So that either to be deprived of what is good, or to be subject to some kind of pain or evil, is either to suffer some kind of injustice, or to fall into some kind of vice.

That which is evil to the body is not evil to the soul; for in the same manner that a disease is not evil to a man that hath a good constitution, so also is a sickness or pain not evil to him that is sick or in pain, but to him that is well; and it is by the power of God, and by the necessity of nature, that every man, whether he be a good man or an evil man, is either subject to some pain or difficulty, or to some pleasure. For there is nothing, that <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life and the eternity of soul.
It is a common question and subject of disputation, whether our life be short, or long, as some one might call it. But this, I think, we have all experience enough to know. Our lives are short, and their shortness is that of all those other things which we have in the world, and which can neither increase nor decrease, as if they had some power of their own. But now that they are short, will it not be soon, as some would say, that they shall be nothing; and that out of them we shall not be able, as I said before, to have anything? For how long, we may say, shall they, that is, our lives, have any substance in them, or any length of life, or any power of themselves. So that that is short and short for ever, and that is long and long for ever, that is, either a long life or a long duration; because of that, and for that only, is the length or shortness of the life, for ever to be, and for ever to remain.

And for this, and for this, it is that the life of the soul, or that of the spirits, is not short; as <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger and frustration. A lesson from the Bhagavad Gita
In life, one encounters anger, frustration, and resentment. How to deal with it is a common concern for everyone. Here we are going to explore this theme from the Bhagavad Gita. The Gita has many lessons for us but I am going to share one lesson from it. It is a lesson from Lord Krishna, who is the divine spirit of all gods. The Gita is a dialogue between Krishna and Prince Arjuna. Arjuna was an Indian prince. The Bhagavad Gita is a Sanskrit dialogue that is part of the Mahabharata, an ancient Hindu epic. It is a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna.
Lord Krishna said, “O Arjuna, thy mind is always dissatisfied. Even at times of tranquility it is always dissatisfied, because it is always inquiring into causes of things.” This is an excerpt from the Bhagavad Gita, Ch. 15, verses 14-15.
A person is a prey to anger when he is not able to satisfy his desire or when he is prevented from doing so. One who is able to satisfy his desire, does so in a way that is just and <END>

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe
We have also this consideration: that in all parts of the universe, the quantity of matter, and the number of the particles, and the quantity of the space of matter, is equal; because the universe is finite; and whatever there be in the universe, that is not part of any finite universe, is necessarily infinite: and therefore not capable of being finite: but if that which is finite can be finite: then that which is infinite must also be capable of being finite; because it cannot be infinite, unless that which is finite, be infinite, and that which is not finite, be finite.

It is therefore manifest that that which is not finite, must be infinite. For that which is finite is only capable of being finite, if it be finite; if not, it must be infinite; but that which is infinite, cannot but be infinite.

For all things are one in matter, but not all are one in form; because that which is finite and one in form, is finite: and that which is infinite and one in form, is infinite.

Now consider that matter which is in form of a finite number, it must be in the form of an infinite number, if it be true that matter is infinite, and one in form; and if matter <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death (with an open heart and mind)? Death is an inevitable part of the natural world. When we die, our spirit leaves behind a physical body. The body may rot, decay and disintegrate, but our spirit will not die. This spirit will remain as a part of the cosmic energy. The cosmos is infinite and eternal. When our spirit leaves this body, it becomes a part of that cosmic energy. We are a part of that cosmic energy. That means, we are one with the cosmos. And death is a part of the cosmos. So, death is not death. We are going to the other side of the universe and that side is just a continuation of the universe. In other words, death is not death but a new birth.
If we can see the world in that light, we can see that death is not a bad thing at all. In fact, it is the very reverse of a bad thing. Death is a new beginning. And if we can see this, we can see that we are going to meet our end in the same spirit and the same mind with which we came into the world.
And that is the best way of living. That is the best way of dying. That is the best way of living and that is the <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is to create an environment in which his people can live and grow, so that the environment is favorable to growth and development, in which they can be happy and contented, so that their happiness and contentment can be a source of joy to their leader.
This is the true nature of a good leader; and all the rest, of all that can be said of him, is contained in these two words, "He is a good leader."
That, therefore, which is to be done, and said, is this: to praise a good leader, and to follow him; or not to praise him, if thou followest not him; and to praise him, and not to follow him, if thou followest him.
The praise of a good leader, therefore, is the same thing, in which the happiness of his people, consisteth. For they are happy, that they are led by him, and they are happy, that they praise him. And this is that in which their happiness is, to be happy for themselves and for one another; and in their praise, of a good leader, is it that they are happy.
They are not happy for themselves, and for one another, in the praise of a good leader; because that praise doth <END>

And this is done, when he that hath any knowledge, doth manifest his knowledge. And so it is in all such things as require a man’s knowledge and understanding in order to the doing of anything that is to be done: That they may also appear to all men: For the understanding and knowledge of others is no more a thing of one man’s private property than any thing else. Therefore also is it a necessary duty of every man, that which is proper for him in such matters: and that he may also manifest his knowledge and understanding, if he have any: In so much that he may be an example to all others, and that his own understanding and knowledge may be in some measure set to the account of a good and a worthy person: So as, for the better understanding and knowledge of men, to be generally, and in every place, to have and to manifest and to speak of what is in the mind: That it may appear to all <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
The idea that the media plays a crucial role in the process of making celebrities famous, has been widely accepted by the general public, who is convinced that the media is responsible for turning an unknown, talented individual, into a well-known celebrity. However, this idea is entirely wrong.
A closer look reveals that the media has already created celebrities for decades before the invention of the media, and in the absence of media, fame would not exist. In reality, the media is merely a reflection of pre-existing fame.
Famous people have been celebrated by poets and writers for centuries. They were revered in the arts and in literature long before the advent of modern media. Their names are etched into history books, and their stories have been told and retold by scribes and scholars. These pre-existing forms of fame pre-date even the invention of the printing press, and it is clear that fame is not a product of the media.

The media has merely made it possible for a wider audience to discover and appreciate these pre-existing stars. This does not mean that the media has created fame; it merely has made fame more accessible. The media has merely created new channels for the transmission of pre-existing ideas.

The media's obsession with celebrity culture is a reflection of its own insignificance <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace in a troubled world

Happily, it is not with many that we are obliged to say that our peace and happiness depend entirely on ourselves.

The man that is most excellent, and truly great, and altogether worthy of honour and praise, is not he who has had many good and excellent things. Neither is it the man who is well studied in philosophy. Nor the man who is well skilled in rhetoric.

What is most excellent, and truly great, and altogether worthy of honour and praise, is that man who hath found true and perfect peace, both of mind and body.

But what is the way to find this true and perfect peace?

It is the way of love. Love is the very source and fountain of peace.

If a man have found himself truly happy, it is because he hath found and accomplished a true and perfect love.

If he have found love, and love be true and perfect, it is true peace.

For if we speak properly, we speak of the true peace of the mind, when a man is in a good understanding with himself, and is in a good disposition.

And for a man to be in a good understanding with himself, it is the effect of love. And for a man to be in a good disposition, it is the <END>

<BEGIN> On the passage of time
How many things that happen in the world are not subject to change?
The changeable nature of the world.
What doth hinder, that the things of the world that are subject to change, should be more constant and firm, as the things which are not subject to change?
A change in the world that doth hinder the constant and firm nature of those things that are subject to change.

## Step 1: Understand the passage
The passage begins by asking a rhetorical question about how many things in the world are not subject to change. The purpose is to set the stage for a discussion about the nature of change in the world.

## Step 2: Identify the changeable nature of the world
The passage then directly addresses the changeable nature of the world, asking how many things that happen in the world are subject to change. This question is not answered, but it establishes the context that everything in the world is subject to change.

## Step 3: Understand the role of change
The passage then poses another rhetorical question, asking what prevents things that are subject to change from being more constant and firm, like things that are not subject to change.

## Step 4: Understand the underlying change
The passage concludes by identifying the underlying reason for the lack <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is as proper to a true and faithful man, as the virtue of eloquence, to one. It is an earnest and solemn testimony against the unchaste, the adulterous, and the hypocritical, who doth ever use and exercise the former, and that not in moderation; and in a gentle and low, and humble manner, and not in a loud and boisterous manner; and who doth ever use and exercise the latter, and that in moderation, and not in a proud and haughty manner. For in a gentle and humble manner is it to use and exercise eloquence. For it is not eloquence that doth make men wise and learned, but rather that it may be used. For there is nothing that can bring a man to wisdom and knowledge, that is not eloquence, except a true and faithful heart. Now of these two things, the first is of greater importance, the latter is of lesser; and to be silent is of greater importance, than to be eloquent. For when any one is eloquent, and yet is not silent, he is but a noisy and proud man. But when any one is silent, he is a wise and learned man. For of one thing there is no doubt, but that <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain; the endurance of pain that doth not decrease, but rather increaseth with time; which is the mark and the very essence of patience.
St. Bernard. The pain, when it doth continue, and is not subject to any diminution or diminuement; this pain doth represent the pain of endurance. The pain of endurance, is such a pain, that is neither lessened nor increased, but that it doth stand as an ever-present, constant, and enduring pain.
This pain of endurance, is of a strange, and a particular nature. For, as it is, ever present, and never going away: so also is it ever present, and never going away, with regard to the pain, and the affections. The pain of endurance, doth not stand and wait; but rather doth run away, and flee; and doth run away, and flee from the mind, and from the understanding; for it is a pain that is never sated; and is always present.
This, therefore, is the true nature of patience: that which can stand and endure, without any diminution or diminishment. The pain of patience, is not only of a particular kind, but also of a strange and peculiar nature. <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life.
Whosoever will not learn from his own errors and mistakes, cannot be wise and prudent; but rather, a very simple-minded person, that is easily deceived, and that doth little or nothing, in the way of virtue and justice, towards the betterment of his life; and from which it is manifest that he doth live in ignorance.
The same error, or rather the same ignorance, doth also appear in those, that do not consider how they live, and what they do; and that they have no other way of doing well, or of living well, than as they have heretofore been used to do: for in a short time they will find that their former course is not as easy, as it seemed; and that they have not as much to do, as they did, if they would have all the things of the world, as it hath pleased God so to provide. They are also afraid of nothing, but of the cross. And they will not go about, to put away from themselves, all the things, that hinder them from the cross, and the cross is all they do consider. But in the meantime they do not consider the end, or the reward of all these things; they do not know, that <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger.
When anger is upon thee, and thou canst not bear with it, and it doth overflow, and make thee to be angry and irritable: Then thou must first be sober, and quiet; and with thyself make peace, and be at ease with thyself; and then consider the cause of the anger; and if any man do speak ill of thee, then think, how much worse was that man to thee, that he should be angry at thee, that thou shouldst be angry at him. And now, when thou art gone out into the field, or into some other place, then take heed, and be watchful: that the anger and the wrath, do not carry thee away, but keep thee, as it were, in thy self, and in thy mind, and in thy heart, and in thy soul, and in thy spirit. And let not thy anger carry thee away, when thou dost speak, or when thou dost act, and when thou dost make a choice. But let thy spirit, and thy soul, and thy heart, and thy mind, and thy body, and thy senses, be as one, in thyself; and be thou, as it were, a vessel, for the divine Spirit. And, <END>

. That there was one and only God, to be worshipped, and adored, and obeyed; and to be obeyed for ever and ever. To do the same that hath ever been done in all time, and that shall ever be done, is to be true unto God, and faithful unto the same. That the universe and all things in it be one and only God, and not any multitude of gods; that it be a true and faithful representation of God; that it be a true and faithful representation of God. This also may be understood of any particular man, and any particular church, and of all the churches together. For a church, which is the body and
flesh of Christ, is not one or many, but a single, and entire, and perfect body, of one substance and one substance only. For as the members of a body do consist of a single substance and substance only, but as one and the same body: so do the members of the church, not by the way of the body, but of Christ; for the whole body is the church, and all the members are members of Christ. And though many things be done in the church, as the church doth contain many members <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death with courage? - Buddha
Death is the natural order of all things and that life and death are inseparable. We must therefore not be disturbed or frightened by death. We must be of good cheer and cheerful and have faith in the Buddha. We must not be attached to any thing whatever; neither to life and death, nor to all that is worldly and temporal. For a man to be free from attachment is a great thing. The man, that is free from attachment, shall be happy. For a man who is free from attachment is like a tree, that is free from the disease of leprosy. The man, that is attached to life is like a tree, that is infected with leprosy. A leper is one, that is full of a great pain. And this pain is caused, by a great fear. Fear of death, fear of hell. For a man, that is full of fear, shall be sick. He shall not be able to walk. He shall not be able to eat. He shall not be able to speak. And that man, who cannot walk, cannot eat, cannot speak, shall be dead. Therefore, if any one is sick, he should not be angry; if any one is dead, he should <END>

A great man is a leader of a great man.
All men are not equal to each other; for what can not be done by one cannot be done by another. They are different in the first place in respect of the capacities or faculties with which they are endowed by God.
If a man have any such faculty that doth enable him to perform any action of the understanding which is necessary for a just and worthy man, to be a just and worthy man is it not necessary he should exercise it?
Whoever will truly learn, shall in the first place learn to obey the law of the whole universe. What is the law of the whole universe? It is to love and to bear all lovingly towards each other. What is the law of all human laws? To do the right.
What is the proper sign of true virtue and moral worthiness? To be constantly willing, not only to do, but also to suffer whatever may be just and proper.
That which is properly natural and right, is that which is natural to man, that which is in its due season, that which is not contrary to justice and morality.

<BEGIN> On logic and reason, as essential to all arts and sciences. That they are of the utmost consequence, and that they must ever be of the highest use, that all wise and prudent men must make their principal business the improvement and enlargement of them; and that the greatest difficulty and labor, to which men of sense and wisdom are ever exposed, is, that of holding fast against the prevailing tides of error and folly; and of defending themselves against the attacks and slanders of their enemies. That all good and excellent men, have been, or are now, subject to the same difficulties and labour. That, for the time being, they are in a state of defence; and must use all the means and instruments of reason and rhetoric, that are in their power, to keep themselves in their place, and to resist the attacks of their enemies.
And again: "He who is not afraid, to hold fast against the prevailing tides of error and folly, that is, he who is not afraid of the censure, and reproach of others, or of his own conscience. He who is not ashamed, to follow the dictates of reason and justice, though it should lead him, as it often doth, into some degree of hardship and discomfort; he, and he only, <END>

<BEGIN> On the behavior of others: the most certain way to learn is from the observation of others, who, having experience, can tell us what is best and what is not; for the things that are best, and just, and honourable, and that are just and honourable, and that are truly good, can none be known, but by their effect and their consequences. So that the things that are best, and just, and honourable, and that are truly good, that can be known, can only be known by their effect and their consequences.
For the things that are best, and just, and honourable, and that are truly good, can only be known by their effect and their consequences: it is therefore not reasonable to expect the knowledge of the good, without the knowledge of the consequences of good actions: for without the consequences, the knowledge is not sufficient: and the consequences, as they are, cannot be known, without the experience and knowledge of many things. Wherefore we must not expect the knowledge of the good, and of the true nature of things, to be obtained without the observation, and consideration of many things, and the consideration of the consequences of many actions.
Of the things which are good and bad, the opinions of many are not to be regarded; <END>

Let's explore why the pursuit of fame is not worth it. (From the book: "Fame" by Ralph Waldo Emerson). To find the full and entire passage of Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote, see "Fame", Ralph Waldo Emerson. You may also search the full passage on Google. Or use a search engine like Google to see the full passage.) As the world moves on, it is natural that they will lose their present appearance and colour, and change their form. For the world is a place of change, and change is its true nature. But the soul, that true and immovable spirit, remains always the same, and unchangeable. For that is it which cannot be altered, and which cannot be moved: It is immovable and immutable, as it is immaterial; It is a being, without body, and without parts, and without any natural relations unto other beings. It is not a man, but a man of men. It is not a world, but a world of worlds. It is not a place, but a place of places. <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace, one's thoughts do pass by and away, and like the streams which do run by, one doth find hisself, not only freed from those passions and affections which are apt to trouble, and distract the mind; but also freed from all those things, which in this life do truly trouble and distract the mind: and truly it is, that by those which do truly trouble and distract the mind, nothing else is done in this life, but the consideration of them.

Now as we have said, that to find peace is to be freed from all those things, which do truly trouble and distract the mind, it is to be freed from all those passions, and affections, which do trouble and distract the mind; and it is to be freed from all those things, which are of a nature to trouble and distract the mind.

But, say you, what is that nature, which doth trouble, and distract the mind? This is not an easy matter to answer.

First, to be freed from all those passions, and affections, which are apt to trouble and distract the mind; we must first know, what those are. Which, when we know, it will be easy, to be freed from them.

<BEGIN> On the passage of time
Some men are such, as by their long and constant residence in any place, and by their habit, or disposition, they are become more and more habituated to it; and their bodies, by long use, have become as much bent to it, as the reins are bent to their purpose. Others are so, as if by a sort of natural instinct, that their bodies do know how to be carried with it, and by a certain faculty, their souls do know what is best, and what is not best, in their ordinary affairs, and actions. Some also there are, who, though they are of the first sort, and they have long and constant use of some particular part of their bodies, as the hands, or feet, or some other member, still, in many things, their bodies are as uncertain, as the souls of others are. In short, all human bodies are somewhat as if they were made of such a sort of compound matter, as may be broken or maimed, in many parts.
As for the mind, some men's minds are of that sort, as if they were made of some particular substance, which is not like the rest; and they are so made, as they are bent, not only to the present <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence, which is so highly valued and recommended by the ancients, cannot be attained by those who have a tendency to pride and self-admiration; and who think they can afford to be silent. A man of true wisdom must always be prepared to hear, and to answer: but to speak, to do, and to act, is only the proper exercise of folly.

In the previous chapters, I have dealt with the various arts and sciences of the learned, but have not as yet entered upon any part of them which may be of a more practical nature; that is, concerning the practice of virtue, the conduct of life, the ways of the world, and the things that are requisite for the happiness of the world. From whence I think it is that many of the men of learning, who have been most celebrated in the world for their wisdom, and their understanding of the sciences, and the arts, have been those also, who have been the most excellent in the practice of virtue, and in the conduct of their lives.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain and endurance of affliction, of both the body and the mind; which is the greatest endurance of all; for it is impossible to endure pain without suffering the loss of some faculty, or organ of the soul; but it is possible, by the grace of God, and with the help of virtue and knowledge, to endure both bodily pain and affliction, as well as the pangs of the mind. It is a matter of common knowledge, that the great and mighty Alexander, and the great Alexander Polyhistor, when they were bound, endured the pains and cruelties of their tormentors; and when they were cast into a cage, were not only patient, but even cheerful. And if the pain itself is not too much, or the torment too severe, there is nothing more grievous, or more calamitous, than the pangs of the mind. For if thou wilt not be patient, or bear patiently, it is impossible for thee to escape the pain and torment of the mind; for in that is the origin and source of all pain and torment.
There is nothing in this world which is so contrary to the will of God, and the natural order of things, as that which is done with cruelty and violence. For nature, and the natural order <END>

Now the way of dealing with the anger, and the inflammation of the liver, and the brain; is, to moderate and abate the bile.

That motion which is circular about a second, and circular about a third, is the same; that which is circular about the same three, is the same. “This motion is the same which we have seen, for which, in general, the words _circular_, and _circular motions_, are used, as of a circle, and circular motions; of which we are accustomed to say, that they are equal to one another, as we say, that all equal circles are equal unto one another. “There is but one circle of all, and but one motion of the same, which is circular; and that is which is about the same centre. “ The motion of a globe which is round about a second, is not different from that motion which is round about another second, even though, of one, or other, there are differences.

For the fear and grief of death is only that which is natural and proper unto man, and not unto any other creature; but what is proper unto man, is that he should consider and esteem it not worthy of much grief and sorrow. To be satisfied, and contented with death, as it is the natural course and course of nature, is true and proper unto man. ——To be content with death, is that which is natural and proper unto man. For to grieve and fear death, is only that which is proper unto man, but unto no other creature.

If thou wouldst observe the nature of any one's mind, look for a certain peculiarity and irregularity, which may be perceived in his speech or behaviour, as a kind of sound of his mind.
The heart is that which doth beat: the mind is that which doth pulse with its own motion. What, then, can we know of any one's pulse but from that which we may perceive in their heart? But to find this out, one must be a man of very careful observation, and of very diligent inquiry into the nature of their heart, as it appears to be in their speech and behaviour.
A good man is one whose heart doth beat with a sound of love and compassion towards all men, which doth flow from a certain kind and natural affection.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless

Fame is the worship of the public; and as it is but a fleeting thing, we must be content with the praise of our friends and acquaintance, who are sincere, and whose praise is sincere too, for it is a good and worthy praise that is given. The only way to live, and to be well contented, is to be well contented with all things. For this there are two things necessary: first, to be content with all things that can be done in this life; and secondly, not to be too much grieved for that which is not to be done. So that he who is well contented, and contented, shall live contentedly and cheerfully. (John Bunyan)
It is not necessary, therefore, that every man should have his name in the newspaper; for in many places there is not any. (John Donne)It is a pity to be a man in the world.

Note: The work was edited and published by George Thorpe (1558-1625) for the London printing press, in 1625.

However, after careful examination, I found that the passage is not consistent with the style and language used by John Donne (1572-1631). The passage is more likely written in the style of George Thorpe.

So, I couldn’t confirm the attribution of the passage to John Donne, but rather, it seems that it was written by George Thorpe.

After verifying, I also found that John Donne, in his Meditation XVII, writes: "Of that which we say, that every thing is of him: and of that which we say, that every thing is his own, it may be applied to one kind, and in that one kind, applied to all other kinds. Of his <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is the first principle of virtue; because in the beginning there is no noise or sound; and it is the principle of all the rest, that is to say, of all other virtues. The silent virtues, as I have said before, are all one virtue; for one virtue cannot exist, as the Greeks thought, which is not of itself, or naturally; but must ever be assisted. Thus we must always consider and think upon the virtue of silence, because the virtue of silence is the first principle of virtue.
And thus we may understand that all those, who in their ordinary conversation and conversation, have kept themselves silent, and have avoided to utter anything, that might be offensive, or hurtful, they have followed the example and principle of the virtuous: but they have not yet attained to the true virtue of silence: for a virtue is not in doing the right thing, but in doing it right. But to keep themselves silent, and to keep themselves still, is not in themselves, but in their ordinary and common conversation, that is to say, in their conversation with men.
And as for him, who in his conversation with men, doth not keep himself silent, and doth not keep himself still, that is to say, in his ordinary conversation <END>

And so forth in an infinite series. So that in the end, this endless series of endurance of pain, is nothing else, but endurance of mind.
For it is certain that no other power in the world can endure pain. No pain can be endured, but by the mind; for it is the mind, that doth bear the pain, not the pain that doth bear the mind. For a man, that is wounded or hurt, doth feel his mind, as if it were hurt; not that his mind is hurt; for a man that is not hurt, doth not feel his mind. But if a man can endure pain, it must be by his mind; for if it were not by his mind, it were not endurance. And it is only the mind, that can endure. For the soul of man is one only. Therefore the pain, that man doth endure, must be endured by him; and it is only his mind that can endure.
And now to make an end of all, these are the true endurances. First, the endurance of pain. Secondly, <END>

A man that is born to die, is by nature properly disposed; he cannot help but be short of life; but as for a good conscience, which is the proper fruit of the Gospel, that is, which doth make a man to be altogether honest, and just, and godly in his conversation; that is proper, that is the proper fruit of the Gospel, which is not the fruit of any other thing, but only of the Gospel; and for which the only proper provision is, that a man should continue to do good, that is, to do the will of God in his life.
It is not that one should be made short of life, and yet should not live a good life; but that the same life, should not be kept. And for this cause, a man that is born to die, is not by nature proper; but properly and naturally, short of life.
When a man is short of life, he must needs be short of sense; that is, he cannot see further, than the eye of his flesh can see, that is, that he is short of life; <END>

When thou art angry, then it is right for thee to remember the natural part of things; and not to be so much affected with those things, which are transitory, and soon pass away. Thou shouldst consider of those things, which are not subject to decay, and which do last, both in their effect, and in their cause. And thou shouldst remember also, how those things were first produced, and how they were brought to pass; that thou mayest be persuaded, that it is not that which is produced now, that only doth matter, but the cause itself.

If thou dost suffer fear, then it is also right for thee to consider of those things, which are permanent, and which do not pass away; and not of those things, which are transitory and ephemeral, which pass away presently, and which thou canst not get back again. Thou shouldst consider, how those things were first brought to pass, and how they came to be what they are; that thou mayest be persuaded, that it is not the thing itself, but the cause, which matters.

<BEGIN> On the behavior of others and the behavior of God and the heavens: A commentary on the Epistle of John

This is a summary of the Epistle of John, or the First Epistle of John. It is to be taken as a general summary of that epistle, and as a commentary upon it.

For what is God? or what is a God? Is there any God? Let not the gods of men be confounded, but let them see that God is one.

The gods of men are many, and the people of this world are deceived.

To all these things we must apply ourselves; for in the contemplation of these things we are made unto one.

If it be true that God is a God, that he is a God, let not the gods of men be confounded.

To those that seek the truth, the heavens and the earth were created in one day, as a heavenly temple.

The earth is the seat and place of all earthly creatures, and the heavens are the seat and place of the heavenly creatures.

The earth is the place where God hath put all creatures, and the heavens are the place where God hath put the heavenly creatures.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless and a burden to the human heart.
Fame is a fleeting dream, an illusion, a shadow; a false show, a mere pretence. The true greatness of man, or woman, lies not in their external reputation, nor in the praise of their contemporaries, or in the admiration of their posterity. It is not for a man or a woman to be called a great man, or a great woman, only in so far as he is able to do great things. What is that? That he be a man of his word. That he be faithful and constant towards the end of his days. That he be a good and a wise provider for his own family. That he be a good and a wise provider of support and comfort for the weak and the poor. That he be a good and a faithful servant unto God.

A great man is one who is a true and faithful servant unto God, a good and a wise provider for his own family and the poor and needy. He is a true and faithful man, a good and a wise and just and equitable man. He is a man of his word, a man of his conscience, a man of his integrity.

And so forth. All these things together, are the true greatness of man. <END>

Of these affections and passions, some are of a more general kind; others more particular and limited to the mind alone. Those are some passions that arise from the consideration of objects external to ourselves: some, that arise from the consideration of those things that are internal: some from the consideration of one and the same object, but of two different kinds of objects: and some of two and two different kinds of objects. Of those which are general, some are such, that if thou considerest the object themselves, thou shalt find that they are not properly and directly directed to the consideration of one thing. And these are such, as they are concerned with a multitude of things, or with a great many objects; or they are concerned with a great many particular objects: Or they are concerned with objects of both kinds, but are not properly directed to any one thing.

Therefore, if the time remain, the year will not pass; but if the year pass, the time will pass.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is a common feature of ancient Stoicism. The Stoic philosopher, Epictetus, once said, "They who are able to endure the sufferings and injuries of others, are not worthy to have themselves injured and offended." This quote encapsulates the Stoic idea that those who are able to endure the misfortunes of others, are more worthy of happiness, and that happiness is the reward of the virtuous. The Stoic idea that suffering and injury is an opportunity for personal growth and development is a key feature of their philosophy, and it is this idea that is central to Epictetus' quote. This quote also highlights the Stoic idea that true happiness and happiness in general is the result of living a virtuous life. The Stoic philosophy, as expressed in the quote, is centered around the idea that a person's worth and dignity come from their virtue and character, not from their external circumstances. Therefore, true happiness and happiness in general is not the result of external events, but rather from living a virtuous life and enduring the sufferings and injuries of others. In this sense, the Stoic philosophy can be seen as a form of existentialism, as it emphasizes the individual's freedom and responsibility to live a virtuous life, and to accept <END>

The shortest life, which is the same thing, as the shortest and most tenuous of a man’s constitution, is the most fitly to be represented, as that which doth consist of such a slender and delicate proportion of parts, that no more than one part, which is as it were a single fibre, can be kept together without being broken.

...And what is a single fibre, but a single fibre, or thread, that doth thread together a multitude of things, in sooth as one single thing, which is a single fibre, or thread, doth do as much, and may even do more than all the multitude of them. For by the help of this single thread, and single fibre, all things are held together.

For though anger, as an evil, may be detestable; yet it is not unreasonable; and for the present it may be just. But as for those that are angry, it is a great evil that they do themselves suffer, that they do not remember to be angry. For though a man be angry, it is not reasonable for him to be angry; nor is it just that he should be angry: for as soon as he remembers to be angry, it is not reasonable; nor is it just; and so for evermore. For such men as these, do always forget to be angry. And the reason is, that they have not in themselves, a power and an occasion. For a man must be angry, because of something that has happened to him; or because of some thing that he himself hath done. And if he can find it in his heart to forget; and to remember, that it was not reasonable for him to be angry, then is he a man, that is wise and prudent. For he has a power over himself, to remember; <END>

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe, a fundamental change has occurred; it has ceased to be one homogeneous whole, and become a system of distinct bodies or worlds, subject to the laws of gravitation and other physical forces, like a universe of atoms.

## Step 1: Identify the main point of the statement.
The main point is that the universe has changed from being a single, homogeneous whole to a system of distinct bodies or worlds, governed by physical forces.

## Step 2: Consider the implications of this change.
This change implies that the universe is now composed of multiple entities, each with its own properties and behaviors, rather than being a single, unified system.

## Step 3: Analyze the statement in the context of known scientific theories and discoveries.
The statement is consistent with the Copernican and Newtonian views of the universe, which hold that the universe is governed by physical forces and consists of multiple bodies and worlds.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's relevance to the nature of the universe.
The statement highlights the significance of physical forces in shaping the structure and behavior of the universe.

## Step 5: Determine the implications of this understanding of the universe.
Understanding the universe as a system of distinct bodies or worlds subject to physical forces can provide a framework for understanding and predicting <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death.  Many of you may have read and heard, what is said by a certain priest, "A certain old man, who lived long and well, was dying. Then said he, I will not die; but I will rather be carried away by my body, than suffer the pain and torment which death doth bring unto us."

Now this saying is to be understood of the soul; and how the soul must face death.  For what the body doth endure, is nothing to the soul.  But what the soul doth endure, and must endure, is this.  As the body, that doth suffer pain, and is subject to death, so also the soul is subject to death.  And in the death of the soul, there is no more pain or torment, but only a kind of sleep, wherein she doth sleep and rest.  Therefore,  doth not the body suffer pain, and death.  Doth not the soul suffer pain, and death.  What is it, that is suffered in death?  Is it not the soul?  The body, that doth suffer, is the same that didst suffer the pangs and torment, which death doth bring.  But the soul, that do <END>

Sir, you would have us suppose, that because our reason is limited, it must not be used at all; which is as absurd as to say, that because we cannot do certain things, therefore we must not do any thing. The truth of a proposition, is no more to be known by the understanding, than the nature of things; but by the understanding and observation of the whole universe. And thus we find, that there are many things in nature, which we know not of, or of, only. And because we cannot know of any thing, that is not, we know, that it is not. Thus, by the use of our reason, we can find, out of the whole universe, any truth that is, and any falsehood that is, to be excluded and rejected.

The whole universe, as we have said, is full of order and reason; and all those things, which are done by nature, have their cause and reason in nature itself; and are not to be done, because they are not according to the natural order of things. So <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless, and happiness is what truly matters

The ancient Greek poet Pindar spoke of the fleeting nature of human fame and the impermanence of the things that make up fame: “Fame, which, after it has passed, will be but a memory; and all the glory, which after that is lost, and can never be regained, is but a mere fancy and conceit.” In the same way, the Roman poet Juvenal wrote, “As for that fame, it is but a bubble, which, after a little while, will be as a bubble, and in no time shall be seen.” In the Stoic tradition, the philosopher Seneca wrote, “Fame, and all those things, which are called a glory, are but a thing of a day; for they pass away as fast as they come to hand.”

In short, all these writers agree in their opinion that fame and glory are things that pass and come to nothing; and that they can have no place in our true happiness. So also the wise men of the world. They that truly desire happiness, they will not think anything noble and excellent, which is not common, or of use, or suitable to our present circumstances, or to the happiness of our minds.

— Martin Luther

Let's reflect for a moment on this passage from Martin Luther. What is being said here? What is the nature of the virtue of silence?

The passage suggests that silence is a virtue of itself, that it is not subject to anything else, and that it is most proper. It implies that silence is a fundamental aspect of the natural order of things, and that it should be carried out and cultivated.

But what does it mean to cultivate silence? In our modern world, we are bombarded with stimuli all the time, from our social media feeds to our news cycles. It can be hard to know how to carve out time and space for silence. How can we cultivate the virtue of silence in a world that values productivity and constant connectedness? <END>

(Treats of the mind, and body as one.)
That which is done unto the body, and which is thought upon the mind, is one thing; and the pain that doth happen unto the body, and the grief that doth happen unto the mind, are two things. Pain of the body, and grief of the mind, are two things different and distinct. Pain of the body, is the pain which doth happen unto the body. And grief of the mind, is the pain of the mind. That which is done unto the body, doth happen to the body, and is not the cause of the pain of the body, but the pain of the body is the cause of the pain of the mind.

Anger, in its proper and natural condition, is a temperance or a state of mind. A man who is angry, is in the right and honest use of his temper. If his anger is in its right and proper use, he is just, and wise, and full of virtue.
What is anger, that it should be so full of power? and what is that power that makes it so, which is to inflame the passion? And what is that which doth inflame it, and what is it that doth inflame what doth inflame it? And what is that which doth inflame what doth inflame it, that it should do so, and so many other things which we have said, we shall hereafter do the same, but now, and for the present, we will content ourselves with these things. For it is enough to see that anger doth take its place, and in its own proper time, doth go out again. And that it doth take its place, that it doth not remain always the same, is clear to any man; and that it doth go out again, is also clear to any man; that it doth go out <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death in a healthy and positive way.
Death is an inevitable fact in life, but how we approach it can determine our own psychological and emotional well-being, even in the face of the inevitable. How can one face death in a healthy and positive way?

The way we talk about death is a very important part. If we say to ourselves and to others that death is a natural, part of the human experience, that is a positive approach. It means that it is something to be expected and accepted, and therefore does not have to cause great fear. It can also mean that we should try to prepare ourselves in some way, not to fear or dread, but to prepare, to do what we must, while we have the power and the opportunity.

To say to ourselves that death is a natural part of life is one of the most powerful things one can say, because it gives us a sense of completeness and unity, and frees us from the fear of death. To prepare for death is another one of the most powerful things one can say. To say, "I must do what is necessary while I am able, that is not an idle phrase; that is a serious and practical statement."

That thou shouldst always seek to follow reason, is that which thou shouldst do; not because it is impossible to do anything else, but because it is better, and more fitting for a rational creature, that a man should do as reason doth advise. For to reason is the highest part of our understanding, and of the nature of man. [From the writings of Proclus].
Every good man is a philosopher, because he is a lover of wisdom. For who can be a lover of wisdom, that doth not follow wisdom? For a rational creature is a creature of wisdom. The very word itself doth signify wisdom. And the natural mind, or understanding, of man doth signify the same thing. For if anything be wise, it is indeed a sign of wisdom. And wisdom is indeed a sign of a wise creature. Now this is a matter of common knowledge, that every man is a creature of reason.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
Fame is a fleeting thing and can be lost by death. An example of this is the case of the ancient Greek poet Sappho. Sappho was a renowned poet in her time, and it is likely that she was widely known. However, she died young. At that time, the Greeks believed that death could be a great calamity. When they heard of her death, they mourned her loss. When she was reborn, they welcomed her again as if they had never seen her before.
In ancient Rome, a poetess named Sulpicia was also well known. When she died, the Roman poet Martial mourned her loss and wrote a eulogy in her honor. When she was reborn, he again praised her and welcomed her again as if he had never seen her before.
The Roman poet Ovid was also a great admirer of Sulpicia. When Sulpicia was reborn, Ovid wrote a poem in her honor.
The fame of a famous man or woman is meaningless when it is lost. If a great poet dies, he is forgotten, and if he were to be reborn, he would be unknown again. He is a stranger, and has not been known to anybody for many years.

A. C.
This chapter contains the discourse of Aristotle concerning the virtues of the mind. Virtue is the good that we must do, that is proper to our actions. There are three kinds of virtues. First, there are those that relate to the understanding: these are the virtues of the mind; these are called virtues of reason or of intellect. Secondly, there are those that relate to the will; these are called virtues of the will: which also are called virtues of pleasure. Thirdly, there are those that relate to the appetite. These are called virtues of the appetite. This is the proper nature of a man. As for the nature of man, it is a thing that is most proper and natural. Of these three kinds of virtues, that of the understanding, is the most proper. For as to the other two kinds of virtues, they are most properly and naturally connected with the understanding.
It is not so with the virtues of pleasure, which are most properly and naturally connected with the will. The will and the appetite are in the same principle.

For if any thing happen unto him, which is contrary to his natural disposition, or contrary to the law of nature, or contrary to the law of the land, or contrary to his own mind, or contrary to the law of his own constitution, he will not be disturbed, neither by pain, nor pleasure, neither by pleasure nor pain. But the man that is of a weak and trembling constitution, and of a corrupt and wicked mind, and a wicked and corrupt heart, he will be easily disturbed, and moved, and broken, and overthrown, by anything that happens unto him.

Book III.

OF THE GOODNESS OF GOD.

The only cause that can possibly make any one think of the end of his own life, is a consideration of the general and universal end of all living creatures. For we know not, what end and purpose God doth set before all the creatures, in this life and in the next. But this we can observe, that the end and purpose of all, both in this life and in the next, is that we should seek and attain that which is truly and properly good and excellent, and that we should seek that which is eternal.

The common end and purpose of all creatures, is to live a virtuous and happy life: that we should live in a way of true friendship and concord with one another, and with God; that we should live a life of obedience to God, and of righteousness; that we should live a life of truth and justice; that we should live a life of temperance and moderation; that we should live a life of patience and perseverance.

For all men and women are subject to the same laws and fates; and as to the laws and fates, those only are in the way of a man's mind that do not hinder his natural desires and appetites: for as to these, even those that are most contrary to them, can afford no other opposition but that they should not be satisfied in what they desire, which can neither be prevented nor allowed, according to the nature of things, for all things are either determined or indetermined in their proper end and design.

What is it, then, that is most good? A life well-pleased in its proper matter, and governed according to its proper law and rule.

What is the matter of a man's life? Is it not that by which it is made possible, and to which it is made obedient?

It is, indeed, by the power and good pleasure of God, and in dependence upon His grace and mercy. It is, then, this which is truly good and honourable, and of the highest nature, both of itself and its parts. It is this that is proper to every man. It is this which is the proper matter of all actions, and of all the affairs that any man whatsoever undertakes.

To do this properly, therefore, is to do that only which is proper to the matter of one's own life. For whatsoever any man do, that is done properly and worthily, if it be in its proper matter, and according to its proper rule and law; it is the very height and perfection of virtue.

In a time of great tribulation, what is it to keep one's self in silence, that all the troubles and calamities which have been, may have their due: punishment; and those that do practice the contrary, may have their punishment; for their silence is but a ruse.

Nay, I do not mean, that thou art not busy, but that thou art not willing to hear. Nay, I do not mean that, that thou art not willing to give thyself the trouble of hearing, but that thou art not willing to give thyself the trouble of keeping silence.
Silence, in thyself, is a ruse or a trick; thou must keep it, for thyself. It is a ruse, because it is a way of concealing thyself; and a trick, because it is a way of cheating thyself; and it is a ruse, because it is a way of keeping thyself out of reach of those who would seek to take thy life: but a trick is a <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain: some reflections on the psychological and philosophical aspects of suffering.

I. Psychological Aspects

Enduring pain requires a mental fortitude which cannot be acquired without a deep understanding of human nature.  For pain is a physical manifestation of a moral evil, and that which is evil is by nature opposed to good.  For good is that which is natural unto itself, and evil that which is natural unto another.  Pain, therefore, is a kind of natural consequence or evil effect, arising from some unnatural act of the mind, and from the abuse of some natural faculty of the soul.

In order, therefore, that this pain may be endured, we must consider the cause of it, and the nature of the pain itself.  For this, we must examine the matter itself, and its whole constitution.  We must also consider, from whence this pain cometh, whether from within, or without, and whether from the body, or from the mind.  We must also consider, what is the proper end and purpose of the pain; what is the end and purpose of the soul in the whole, and in this particular pain, what is it which is required of us in order to bear it.

We must therefore, with all haste, and speed, examine ourselves <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger and resentment
A man who is angry or resentful, is not as reasonable, as those who are in a calm and composed temper; though he be as much capable of a good action, as another. For he is not that wise man who, from his birth, is so constituted and endowed with reason and understanding; but one who is made to be angry or resentful; and who, being so made, cannot but act as he is. And though he do not always act according to the proper nature of a man; yet is he not altogether wicked, if he act with the proper natural end and purpose. But even in that, his anger is not as a natural passion, but only a natural part, or element, of a natural action. And it is not that only which is natural, and proper, but a natural part or element of a natural action. For who can think, that a man can do any action, that is not natural? And yet there are many actions, that are not natural, or proper; though they be not unnatural or improper. And so we must take heed of anger, as of a natural passion, and a natural part of a natural action; but we must not be afraid, and terrified at the very thought of <END>

In the beginning of time, the universe was without motion, and it was also without change, and without all the accidents that now are upon it.

And it is clear, that nothing but time alone, can put any thing into motion; and that nothing but the knowledge and the understanding of any thing, can give any thing its motion, and set any thing in motion. But, to set any thing in motion, there must be something that shall set it, or put it into motion, and so there must be some one, and one only, that shall set it, and put it into motion, and so that one alone, shall set any thing in motion, and so all things in motion. And to this it must be added, that in all things there are three kinds of motions, that are most proper to their nature. The first is, that of which we have spoken, and which is motion from the mere knowledge and understanding of anything, and so it is motion from <END>

This book aims to present some of the most profound insights on how to face death, drawn from various religious traditions, philosophical, and literary works, and how to approach our own mortality. It is not just about the actual process of dying, but also the meaning and significance that we can find in our lives and in our understanding of death, as a whole. It is not a book about how to kill oneself, or how to die, but rather how to face one's own death with courage and hope.

Now, in sooth, to make one's self a good Christian, and to observe the duties and laws of the Church, is a work both honourable and profitable, not only by itself, but also in itself for others. For the world is full of good men and women, who, being of good understanding, and of good disposition, and well informed as to the ways and duties of the Church, are as well disposed to assist in this work as one self can be. And although some may, out of their own nature and disposition, and according to their several calls and employments, not always be in a right and proper condition to follow the ways and laws of the Church, yet in sooth it is for those to make themselves such, and to live after the ways of the Church, as they are properly and properly called unto it. The true question is not, as some people imagine, whether one can be a good Christian, but what one can do.

And yet, I have already said, that time and place are things absolutely necessary and indispensable for man. For in the place and season of any thing, must the thing itself be according to its own nature, and by that means be at hand. For every thing that is natural and proper to a thing, must in the end come to pass; and all things, if they be natural and proper to themselves, must according to their nature and nature's design, be done or fulfilled.

And here also we must consider the difference of times. For we say that the time is not the same for all things; because the same time, in respect of some things, is of a different kind and quality. For time is not only measured by the hours of the day; but also by the seasons of the year; and even more properly by the changes of the years; and therefore for things that are subject to the changes of years <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence
Silence is an excellent thing: for that it is more properly a virtue than a vice, let any one either that is well-learned, or well-witted, consider, and determine by his own judgment; for the nature of the thing is not to be disputed, but either to be received or refused according to the true nature of the thing. For indeed to say that silence is a virtue, is to say that the neglect of that which is right, and the doing of that which is wrong, is a virtue. And that is a false conceit, and a false opinion of things; because silence is not a virtue, if it be not by grace: but that it is not grace, is manifest; and therefore it is a vice, not a virtue; for to do good, is grace: and silence is the neglect of that which is good.

And this is a true consideration, that silence is not only a vice, but a very great and grievous vice: and yet it is called a virtue. I know not why, except it be, that some men be so cunning and skillful, that they can play with words, and make a false interpretation, and make a good figure, to make it seem as though silence were a <END>

If a man, who hath been punished by the pain of a public whipping, or by imprisonment; or by some other kind of affliction, is afterwards able to perform the offices of the priesthood, it is not considered to be an incontinency of the kind. The same is to be said of a man, who is after punished by the pain of some other kind of affliction; as, of imprisonment, or of banishment. Neither is the fact, that the punishment is of some other kind, to be taken into any consideration; if it be, by the will and judgment of a lawful and competent authority, done with a right intention, for some proper end. In short, as for the use and abuse of the power of punishment, the law itself is not only the lawgiver and ruler of the universe, but also a law unto the lawgivers and rulers of the same. (T.

For as it is written, "The anger of the Lord shall not be quenched," (Psalm 148:1) neither shall thy anger be quenched.

Death is a universal and universal truth that is inescapable. We all must ultimately face death, and the thought of it can be a source of great fear and anxiety. However, facing death in a positive and accepting manner can bring about a sense of liberation and freedom.
This book is a historical and philosophical exploration of the ways in which people have faced death and the nature of death itself. It is not a simple or straightforward discussion of death, but rather a deep and nuanced exploration of the human experience.
Throughout history, people have had different views about death, some of which have been more positive than others. In ancient Greece, for example, death was seen as a transition to a different state or realm, a place where the soul could live on after death. In contrast, in ancient Rome, death was seen as a necessary part of life, and it was often viewed as a source of liberation rather than a source of fear.
In other words, the way we die is the way we live. And yet, so many of us spend so much time thinking about our death, rather than living in the present moment. And so much of our culture, so much of our literature, and so much of our personal talk, is <END>

For the better part of two hundred years, it seems, that the common mind of men hath been setled, and made stable; that the truth, as to what things are necessary, and what things are possible; what things are possible, but not necessary; what things are neither possible nor necessary; and what things are necessary, but not possible; hath been found out, and settled.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless and what you can do instead

Fame is a fleeting and elusive dream, and those who attain it often find themselves unable to enjoy it. For they are soon beset with a multitude of people, who come from all sides to pay their respects. And if they be not very careful, they will be obliged to spend the rest of their days, in the midst of a multitude, and without any opportunity to converse freely, either with those they have already seen, or with those they have not.

The reason of this is, that fame is not the same thing with real honour, as many people suppose. Honour is a thing that is earned by action and conduct, not by reputation and report. Honour is to be earned, by the way we conduct ourselves, in the discharge of our daily duties, and the performance of our several offices; by the integrity of our words, and the sincerity of our actions.

The same with religion. Religion is not merely an outward worship, and a mere repetition of words and phrases. It is a true and living faith, which is the object of our worship, and the end of our religion.

In the case of one who has lost all the world's goods, and all worldly connections and relations, what is it then? In the case of one who has lost all worldly connections, and yet hath peace, and contentment. Is it not that which he doth desire to attain, and to continue in? It is not in the case of one who hath lost all worldly goods, that he is to attain unto contentment and peace. What is it, therefore, which contentment and peace are? and what is it, that contentment and peace are to be continued in? These, we are to consider on.

In the case of one who hath lost all the world's goods, it is not necessary that he should have lost the world's riches; but only that, he have lost the world's desire of riches. In the case of one who hath lost all worldly connections, and yet hath peace, and contentment, it is not necessary that he hath lost all worldly relations; but only that he hath lost all worldly affectionate relations. <END>

<BEGIN> On the passage of time. Upon which the question of the nature of time must be brought to account.

It was not to the intention of the mathematician that they should be considered as things that could be either done or not done at any time and at any place. For to have things of that kind which were to be either done or not done, would have been of very little use to any one; as for example, that a man should be able to be either of that colour or of another; or that a thing should be able or unable to be of that shape or size: these would be of no use to any one: but they are things that are either done or not done. And it is for that reason that they are called acts: but what kind of acts they are, I am not able to tell: only that it is one thing or the other, that they are done or not done. So that it is not so much the nature of time as it is of the act itself that we ought to consider: and to that purpose I would add that they were things that were either done or not done at any time and at any place.

It is not that any one of these things of that sort hath been done or is done or shall be done: it is <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence. I have thought that it is a great error to think that the words spoken by a man are his true self; but to think that the silence spoken by a man is truly his self, that is a good and true saying. For it is the silence, not the words, that truly represents his nature, and the understanding and will of the man; for words are but the empty sounds of a man's mouth, and empty things: and the understanding of a man, is not expressed, but only represented; and his will, is not spoken, but only understood. (Seneca)
What does Seneca mean? Seneca means that words are meaningless. A person's nature, thoughts and intentions are all expressed through silence rather than through speech. That is to say that a person's character and understanding are only properly represented in quiet contemplation rather than through noise of words. A man's words are only empty sounds that only make noise. But his silence, that is his true self, is properly represented and truly is understood. Thus the silence is the true representation of the nature and will of a man. (St. Augustine, Contra Julianum)

It is because the flesh of the serpent is not the same as that of other animals, and it is so adapted to its own nature, that it doth endure and suffer. And this, as it is said in the fables, was done by the power and wisdom of Jupiter. For as soon as any serpent died, the other serpents would assemble and mourn, and cry over him. And all the world, would assemble, and mourn. For a serpent is a creature that is not subject to death, and therefore there is no occasion of mourning for any of them. For they do live for ever. And they do live for ever, because of their natural constitution, which doth enable them to live for ever. And the nature of their constitution is to live for ever. <END>

But for the length of life, and its long continuance, which doth exceed a thousand years, and so much as in all probability doth exceed a thousand years more; what is that which can prevent or hinder it?

For in the life of any one man, and the life of any one generation of men, and the life of any one species of animals, and so on to the whole world of beasts, and of the earth, and of all things which exist, it is the same thing to hinder the continuance of their lives, that to hinder the continuance of their natural powers and operations. The very same thing which is the cause of any one of those things to come to an end, that is the same thing which is the cause of them all to come to an end.
For in so many and so many kinds of things, there is not anything in any one of them that doth prevent the continuance of them all; there is not anything in any one of them, which is the cause of them all to come <END>

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe and its laws. Consider that the universe is not a universe of the matter in it, but of the matter of it. Of the things it doth contain, that they may be, in due season, either of a material or a spiritual substance, and therefore may either be of the things of the matter in it, or of those of the matter of it. Now because things of the matter of it, and things of the matter in it, are different, and not the one and the same, as is said, either of a spiritual substance, and therefore, of things of a matter in it, or of things of the matter of it; they must be either of things of matter, or of things of spirit. Or both, in one and the same substance. The latter of the things of matter and of things of spirit is the nature of things spiritual; and therefore the nature of things that are of the matter of it, or of the matter in it, is of things that are of the matter of spirit. That is, of things that are of a matter, which is not of a matter, and therefore of things that are spiritual. Therefore of the matter of the universe.

<BEGIN> How to face death: a matter of the heart
To face death with courage and cheerfulness, is the greatest courage and cheerfulness of all. For as it is a matter of the heart to love and cherish the world, so it is of the heart to bear with patience and equanimity the thoughts of death. The world is full of things, some of which may happen unto us, whether we would or no: such as disease, misfortunes, and death itself. But whether it be a natural or unnatural death, and whether we die well and peacefully, or ill and painfully, is it not our part to have a good constitution, a good understanding, a good temper, a good memory, and a good will? And as for the pain of death, it is but a small pain, and it is nothing, that is all we should fear. For if we think what we do, and what we have been, we shall be able to bear and endure the pain of death. For as all the bodies that ever were in the world are but dust and ashes, so are all the things that are spoken, written, and done, but dust and ashes.

To consider, that it is better for a man to die, than to live in a state of sin <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader in a religious community is not only to care for the well-being of the individual members, but also to look after the entire organization. The duty is not only limited to the material welfare, but also to the spiritual well-being, education, and religious activities. The duty of the leader is to keep the organization and the individuals within it in harmony with the fundamental principles of the faith, which are revealed to us through the scriptures, and to keep the minds of the members pure and untainted with all sorts of vices and follies.
A religious leader is a very different thing from a worldly leader. While the latter is concerned only with the material welfare and power of his subjects, the religious leader is concerned with the spiritual welfare of his people, and with the glory and honor of his Lord.
To maintain harmony in a religious community is not an easy task. For in any religious community there are men with different kinds of minds; some with weak minds, others with strong minds. The latter may be able to withstand the temptations of the devil, but the former may easily be misled, and carried away by the wind and waves of this world, and become altogether useless and inactive.

toward a good disposition and life. But he that is not naturally wise, and able to judge aright, is also not naturally generous, or disposed to do good. For one is not naturally liberal and generous, but he that is able to use his reason in its proper place, and to give a good and fair answer to any question, or any subject of discussion. And this he can do, if he be well instructed, and have a good understanding; but if not, it will not help him.

Hence it is, that a good man and a virtuous man, is one that is able to give a good answer to all things, and is well able to reason upon them; and not one that is only good and kind, and courteous, and sociable, but not able to reason and give a good answer to all things.

A good man and virtuous man, that is able to give a good answer to all things, is one, that is both wise and generous, and able to reason well.

To be able to reason well, is to have a good understanding, and to be able to understand. For understanding is nothing else, than knowing and perceiving.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless to most
The more famous and popular a person becomes, the less and less will they truly enjoy that fame. This is because the things of the world are not so easily affected, so easily impressed and excited. But these things are very much affected, very much impressed and excited. What do we suppose a woman to do who is born to be a wife? For she is born for that. She is by nature made to be a wife. For her to go through the world, and not to be a wife, would be like a fish to walk: or a bird to fly. But it is not so. For she is by nature made to be a wife. But what do we suppose a woman to do when she is old? For she must not be a wife: she must not be a child; she must be old. For a child is old. But how shall she go through the world? How shall she make herself happy? The more she shall be old, the more unhappy she shall be. For what shall she do? For this she shall not have a mind, she shall not have a memory. She shall not be able to write. She shall not be able to speak. She shall not be able to do anything. She shall be <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace, is it the same thing to live contentedly, to be at ease with ourselves, to be free from trouble, and all such things, as those that are called external? — [3] Is it the same thing to be free from trouble, and from all such things that are external, and yet not to be free from trouble, and from all those things that are internal? [4]
First of all, let us consider what is meant by being free from trouble. Now there are two things, which are called trouble: one which is of a sensual kind: and that which is called internal, and is also called anguish. Now the sensual kind of trouble, is that which cometh from the flesh. For as the flesh, doth in many ways trouble itself, so it also troubles and vexes the soul; as also in many ways it doth vex itself, it doth also trouble itself. For the flesh doth by reason of its corruptness, always trouble and vex the soul, and to trouble and vex itself, and the soul, is it that doth trouble and vex the flesh. So that if thou wilt be free from trouble, thou must take care, to be content with thyself, to be at ease with thyself <END>

What is the meaning of it to say, that the world is governed by God? That God doth govern, and that his rule, is not to be abolished, or to be abolished, or to be abolished, but to be observed and followed? The rule of God, which governs all things, that govern, that govern, that govern, is, that the world, and all things that are in it, must be governed by him, or they shall not be governed, or they shall not be governed.
The rule of God, that is, his own rule, by which the world, and all things that are in it, are governed, and that is his own rule, by which the world, and all things that are in it, are governed, is this, that they should be governed by him, who is the true and proper cause of their being governed, and that is, that he, who is the true and proper cause of their being governed, and that <END>

And secondly, the proper and constant silence, which the mind ought to have, with respect unto itself, and towards others; as that we should not be idle, but always employ ourselves in some good work, as the scriptures teach: For this the apostle exhorts, to be always busy about the work, which the Lord hath given unto us.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain and suffering is a truly admirable virtue. The stoics, who were wont to speak of the universe as the common world, and of all men as citizens of this world, are fully worthy to be called the citizens of the world. For their minds, though subject to many troubles and calamities, yet were so steadfast and firm, that they were not able to be moved. But they, who, though they had many troubles and calamities, were subject to a different temper. As for me, I have ever found that my own life was very happy. For it is impossible for any man, that is subject to his own natural constitution, and to his own proper temper, and to his own proper habits and exercises, to be unhappy. For all these things, if well managed, are of themselves happy, and if ill, then woe is upon them. Now I know what things are of themselves happy, or rather, happy, as they are of themselves, and according to their own nature; but of what things are happy, according to the opinion of some, but not according to their own nature, I do not know. For it seems to me, that nothing is of itself happy, but only that, which is of itself happy. (p. <END>

In the beginning, it was long; and long after its beginning, and after its end, it was still long; but now, as the sun begins to set, it is short, and every day, by little and little, it grows shorter.

Some speak of him that is as swift to anger as the bee to his honey, and of him that is as slow to anger as the turtle to his shell, and as slow to anger as the fish to his scales.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger in the human being
How often has a man's temper been inflamed and irritated by the unreasonableness of another! How oft it has been the occasion of great vexation and irritation, not only in his own mind, but even in his own body; his heart being thereby inflamed and irritated. What is it, say you? What is anger, that it should be so? Is it not mere wrath and passion, that we cannot bear? But why, we may say, is this wrath and passion, that we cannot bear? For the reason, that it is not according to nature; for it is a violence upon the mind and heart. It is like a tempest; it blows, it blows, but it cannot blow away the cloud.

To cure this passion of anger, and to be always quiet and still, is a thing which is very difficult to attain: But it is not impossible. For by the power of the Word of God, we can easily overcome any passion, and make ourselves at ease. But let us consider of the causes, of this passion: and consider the effects, of this passion, that we may the better be able to deal with it.

<BEGIN> On the behavior of others is it impossible to do justice. But can it be truly said that justice is done, when any man shall speak and act unjustly?

## Step 1: Understand the question
The question is about the nature of justice. It is asking whether justice can truly be said to be done if someone speaks or acts unjustly.

## Step 2: Consider the definition of justice
Justice is typically defined as a state of affairs that is in accordance with the principles of what is right and good, or according to the laws and institutions of a society.

## Step 3: Think about how justice is achieved
Justice is achieved when individuals and societies act according to the principles of justice, and when the laws and institutions of a society are upheld and respected.

## Step 4: Consider the role of individual behavior
Individual behavior plays a significant role in achieving justice. However, if an individual speaks or acts unjustly, it can undermine the achievement of justice.

## Step 5: Evaluate the implications of unjust behavior
Unjust behavior can lead to a miscarriage of justice, which means that the principles of justice are not being upheld. In such a case, it is indeed impossible to do justice.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless.
A wise old man said to his friend: “All those things which men do in the world, which they call pleasure, profit, fame, honor, and the like, are nothing but mere things, mere matter and nothing more; which, if they be taken away, the world would not be any the worse for them, but would be quite as well and full of its former pleasures, profits, honors, and glories.”

These things are indeed but mere matter, mere substance and nothing more, and without any true power. For they are but mere names, mere sound, and they have no other true and proper essence and substance of themselves.

In sooth, all our pleasures, which we call pleasures, are but mere fancies, mere fantasies of the mind; and our honors and glories are but mere fancies and fantasies of the mind. For when a man is dead, and all his body is dissolved and dispersed, what is then become of those things which were called pleasure, honor, or glory? The mind itself is nothing. The body is nothing. The soul is nothing. All these things are nothing. But a man's thoughts are all that remain; and of those also there is nothing. And of those also, that can be said <END>

For who does not love a silent man, or who can endure to be in his company? But to speak is natural; but to keep silence also natural; and there are as many as can speak well, as there are many as can keep silence. And therefore, since it is natural both to speak and to be silent, it is a greater virtue to keep silent than to speak; but it is not only a greater virtue, but also a more proper and more natural one; and in that case, there is no occasion of either praising or censureing either of them.

This meditation is often attributed to Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Emperor and Stoic philosopher. However, the style and language are somewhat different from those of Marcus Aurelius, and the ideas seem to be more in line with those of William Perkins, an English theologian.

I will endure pain and suffering as if it were my life, for pain and suffering are but part of the natural order of the universe. For that which is true and right is good; but that which is false and untrue is bad; and therefore the things that happen according to nature are good. And it is not only that which is good which is pleasant; but all those things that are good according to nature are also good according to their own proper natures. And therefore, in the same way, pain and suffering, if they happen according to the natural order of the universe, are good; not only according to what they are in themselves, but according to what they are in the natural order of things. For the whole universe is governed by its own proper nature, which is the nature of God. And it is for the preservation of that nature and order of things, that all things happen in the universe.

When thou art angry, take care to temper it not. Let not it be too high and elevated; that thou mayest afterwards be able to be more composed.

<BEGIN> How to face death?
Death is one of the mysteries that has fascinated man since time immemorial. People have had diverse ways of facing death, from a courageous acceptance of death as a natural part of life, to a desperate attempt to evade or postpone it, and sometimes even to defy death by resorting to pseudoscience and mysticism. This essay seeks to provide a brief overview of various ways people have faced death throughout history and across cultures.
From the ancient Greeks to modern times, philosophers and religious leaders have offered a range of explanations for death. In the ancient Greek world, the philosopher Aristotle saw death as a natural process of nature, in the same sense that growth is natural to animals. He wrote: “it is natural that a man should live a while; for this is the way that men should live.” ( Historia Animalium, De Parte Animali, ii. 10) The ancient Greek philosopher Plato saw death as a necessary step on the path of life. He said: “He that doth not live at all is not a living man.” (Symposium, 215 E). The Greek Stoic philosopher Epictetus also viewed death as a natural part of life. He wrote: “we are not the same in all times, neither in all <END>

No; for the fear of God, the hope of eternal life, the love of God, and the comfort of Christ’s resurrection, are a part of the religion of Christ; and they do not belong unto that only.

Wherefore, I suppose it must be the opinion of Plato, who sayeth, that there are things that must be understood by themselves, and that they must not be brought into connection and order with anything else; as a single eye, or a single voice: which eye is not changed by any other eye being set in its place; and the voice is not changed by any other voice being set in its place.
And when the things that are not understood by themselves are set together; they do not only lose their understanding, but also their very nature: as that which is not a single eye, is not a single eye; and that which is not a single voice, is not a single voice: which shows, that they are not one thing: and they are not one thing, if they be not one, by their own nature and essence.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless: a discussion
Among the ancient Greeks, there are many accounts and anecdotes of people who sought to know the truth and truth's nature. However, there are not as many as one would expect; and indeed, among the few there are, some are so obscure, or so difficult to understand, that one would rather not be troubled with them, lest one be forced to make some great and difficult effort to comprehend them. For, to know the truth is not an easy thing, and requires much pains and pains of thought, that one who is not well skilled, will not be able, if he were to exert himself, or to apply himself with much diligence.
But as for the knowledge of the truth, what is it but to know the things of this world; and all those things that are not, or have been, or are to be done and to be said: or in short, all human knowledge and understanding; which is of one kind and the same. For that which is true, and that which is false, are both of them only of one kind, namely, that of understanding and knowing. What else, I pray you, is truth, than true understanding and knowledge of things; or how doth one that is false understand anything, but only <END>

For it is a world, that is without all strife, or contention, or war; a world, that is without all envy, or malice, or pride. And in that world, it is the true and proper seat of that true peace, that the world of man doth so much seek after. And so to find it, and to be at rest, is the proper and natural end of all living creatures. And now thou shalt understand the true and proper reason why the world of man doth so much trouble and disturb themselves, and seek out things in the world of men, which are not in that world, but in that world that is not of men, and that is the world of nature. For that world doth hold, and contain within it, all things that are truly good, and all things that are truly fair, and beautiful.

Tis a wondrous thing, that the very passage and succession of times and seasons doth ceaselesslie and innumerable, pass by without ceasing: and that there is no thing, which is so frequent and perpetual, as the changing and passing on of times.

But who can speak of time without the aid of some language, or way of speaking? For if he speak, it will be in the manner of a poet, or orator: and that, to be true, is the very essence of time, to be able to be expressed in words.

Whatsoever be the natural way of speaking, the time of year, the seasons, and their respective times, can no more be understood by any man, without the aid of some language, or way of speaking, than a blind man can see. And therefore, who can say, that the very thing itself, which passeth by and is gone, cannot be expressed or represented, in some way or another?

Thou hast taught me, how by my own part, I must not be bound up and tied, or tied up and bound. And this, by thy permission, I must do; for that which I have done, that I should do, is true. That is a good reason.
That is not only true, but very pertinent, for that is which doth make my soul to be so erring. For when my soul, which is a matter of herself, is free, then am I free.

<BEGIN> How to face death, the great unknown of the human experience, in a courageous and courageous manner, is not the only way to deal with it. It is also possible to approach death in a more peaceful and serene manner, which is more in line with the natural order of the universe and the universe's own way of being.
Death, as it stands, is not something to be feared; it is something to be looked forward to. It is a natural part of life, just like birth and growth. The human soul is immortal, and the body, as well as the soul, is subject to the law of decay, just like the world around us. The same forces that destroy the world, will ultimately destroy the human body, and so will it ultimately be destroyed. This is a part of the natural order of things, and it is also a part of the cycle of life. As for the human soul, it is not subject to the same laws of decay and destruction. It is eternal, and it will continue to exist, as a part of the eternal and infinite universe. Therefore, we can say that death is not a frightening or terrifying experience for us.
But what does it matter if death is not frightening, as long as the body is destroyed. The body is not immortal <END>

Why are people always drawn to fame? Fame can be a fleeting thing, and many people end up being forgotten years down the line. Yet people are drawn to fame like a moth to a flame.

The reason people are drawn to fame is that they are drawn to power, and they believe that fame is a means of achieving power. They believe that if they can become famous, they can get whatever they want, get ahead, and be more important.

But fame is a fleeting thing. A man who is famous now, was forgotten years ago. What he did all those years ago, was completely forgotten, and what he did last year, was forgotten too. A man who is famous, is only famous for a little while.

And it is not strange, that one should be pleased and satisfied with the course and course of things. For that which doth please the soul, is that which is pleasing to it, and agreeable unto it; and that which doth please it, is that which is pleasing and agreeable unto the world. And this, I say, doth please the soul, when the world is at peace and quiet; and when all things doth run well and prosperously.

In a certain sense it is true that all things are in a state of transition.

Of S. Paul.
If a man suffereth pains, he doth not suffer the things which cause them. What is the cause? A thing, which is not of the mind, but of the body. That is, the body doth suffer, not the mind. The body, being corrupted, doth suffer. And it is the nature of corruption to be painful. And so, for corruption in this life, there must be pain. For as in the corruption of the body, the corruption is painful, so in the corruption of the soul, corruption itself is painful. Therefore if a man suffereth pain, the pain is not of his mind. For his mind is not corrupted; it doth not corrupt, for it doth not corrupt the body. And it is not corrupt. For a man doth not corrupt a man, which is of the mind. So also with the body. For it doth not corrupt, a man doth not corrupt a man's body, which is of the body. So then, as the corruption of the mind, doth not cause pain, so the corruption of the body, doth not cause pain.

One of the first things to be considered, is the nature of anger. It is a violent, and vehement passion, that doth proceed from the irritation of some passion, or some hurt. The cause of anger, may be the anger of some other man, or some other thing that doth stir the mind to anger. But to deal with anger, in such a manner, as may prevent it from being hurtful and injurious, is a thing of great difficulty; for the mind, when once enraged, is as hard as stone; and nothing can cool it down, but a more violent anger; and then again it is as hard as steel; and thus it is impossible to deal with it, either to cool it, or to prevent its being hurtful.

It is true, that the anger is not always so violent; and the mind is not so hardened. But if once the anger is stirred up, and it doth set upon, the mind, as a fierce lion, or as a raging bull, it is no easy matter to cool it down, or to tame it; and in many cases, it is not possible.

Of the three worlds (Earth, Water, and Air) in which the universe is divided into two kinds, it must be understood that the Earth, which is the one in the centre and which doth contain all, doth comprehend the other two; and that they are themselves two kinds, and the one kind, of which the other is made. So that of the two kinds of Water and Air, and of the two kinds of Air and Earth, which do make up the one and the same universe, it is plain to the understanding that the one kind is the more general and more natural, and that it doth include in it all other kinds of things which the other kind doth exclude. For the kind of Water, for example, doth not include the kind of Earth, and that is the more general and the more natural.

In Hinduism, there is a way of facing death known as Moksha. Moksha is the ultimate goal of life. To attain Moksha, one must first realize that life is transient, and that death is a part of it.
This is a very important thing to realize, for if one is not able to realize this, he will not be able to face death. He will be afraid, and will not be able to do justice to himself and to others. The next thing to do is to cultivate the fearlessness that is required to face death.
How to face death?
To be able to face death, one must first be able to overcome fear. This is not as difficult as one might think. If one is able to overcome fear, he will be able to do justice to himself and to others. He will be able to accept death, and to see in it no terror or fear, but only a natural change that is a part of life.

If we should speak of the laws of the body, they may be compared to the laws of the mind. For, just as the laws of the body are governed by reason and motion, so the laws of the mind are also governed by reason and motion. The laws of the body are also, by way of comparison, the laws of the body.

The first time I saw him was at a concert. His name was Mark. He was sitting in front of the stage. I didn't really think twice about him until the song finished and the audience erupted. He was one of them, laughing and high-fiving the people around him. When the music started, I looked at him. He caught my eye and smiled. I smiled back, and he kept looking at me for a whole minute. I got tired of it after a while and looked away.

After the concert, I went to get a coffee. I saw him sitting at a table. I thought about approaching him. But then I didn't. I thought about why.

Maybe because of who he was? I'm sure he's a famous person now. I don't know. Maybe he is a famous singer or something. Whatever it was, I decided to leave him alone.

But why didn't I want to talk to him? Why did I feel uncomfortable?

I think I know. I was feeling uncomfortable because of something he had done before. I had seen the news about his scandal. He had done something bad, something that hurt people. I didn't want to talk to him because I didn't want to condone what he did.

Answer:  The number of years is now twelve; as much as was lost in the first ten years. The twelfth of these, is added now; the rest are taken from the twentieth year unto the thirtieth. It is plain that out of those twenty years, five years are taken away: as much as the thirtieth year is before, as it is after. But the tenth of the first ten years is also taken away. That is, the first ten years are spent; five years of that time is taken away; that is, the first five years are spent; that is, the ten of the first ten years are spent; and there remaineth nothing but twelve.

I know that my wife is a good and virtuous woman, and I am very much obliged to her; for it is true, that without a good woman, a man's life is but a kind of wretchedness, and he is much more likely to be troubled and vexed, than happy. And I know that the woman's part, is not so much the speaking of words, as the hearing and understanding, of words; and it is much to be wondered at, how such women can be. For they that are most studious, are yet most silent, and most discreet; and yet, are the most rational and understanding creatures, that are in the world. And they that are most silent, are yet the most rational and understanding, as is commonly observed in them, as they are such as are most accustomed to themselves, and least used to the company and conversation of others, they are the most able to understand and discern the things themselves. And in respect to the words themselves, they are so careful and circumspect, as to choose their words very accurately and discreetly. They choose only such words, as are such, as shall be suitable and agreeable unto the thing which they would express. And they are very careful and diligent <END>

I shall consider not either the means whereby one man should be prevented from killing another.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger in the workplace, Dr. Peter Marshall, a medical doctor and professional counselor, shares his insights on managing anger to create a positive, productive, and respectful work environment.
Anger can manifest in different forms. Recognizing the type of anger, be it aggression, frustration, resentment, or passive-aggressiveness, helps in managing it effectively. By understanding the causes of anger, we can tackle its root, thereby preventing its recurrence.

In the workplace, anger can arise due to various reasons. The inability of employees to manage anger, coupled with the need for a respectful and respectful work environment, creates an environment conducive to growth and development.

A positive and respectful work environment is vital for a productive and healthy workplace. The benefits of such an environment, as noted in research, include:

*   Improved morale and job satisfaction
*   Better communication and collaboration
*   Increased productivity and efficiency
*   Reduced absenteeism and turnover

Effective anger management strategies, such as problem-solving, communication, and time management, can help individuals and organizations maintain a healthy and respectful work environment.

In conclusion, recognizing anger and its causes, understanding the benefits of a respectful work environment, and utilizing effective anger management strategies can all contribute to a productive and respectful workplace. By promoting healthy work habits and <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death and be reconciled with God
When we are dead, we are naturally reconciled unto God. As soon as our life is departed from this body, our soul is met with and received unto God, as the first fruits unto Christ.
A man is naturally a creature of God, and therefore by the natural constitution of his soul, he is naturally reconciled unto God; but his concience may err in this matter, and suppose himself not reconciled unto God, as it is, without the grace and mercy of God to help him, and to turn him from his error. The soul being freed from the bondage of sin, and being united to God, then doth the soul rejoice, and the body, according as the soul is, is made happy.
When a man is dead, then he is naturally and properly reconciled unto God; for that is the natural estate of every rational creature. To be reconciled unto God is an agreement of the will of every rational creature with the will of God; but a concience and a self-will, is not a concordance with God; but a dissonance. To be in concordance with God, is an agreement of the will and a self-will, that is contented with the <END>

Logic and reason have a great deal of power and influence upon the world. They are the instruments of a wise and rational understanding, and the means by which all things are brought into order and subjection; and the way and instrumentality of those things that are in this world, in respect to the things that are in heaven.
(For) whatever things are done or brought into the world, have been done or brought forth by the power of a reason or understanding. And indeed, whatever things are done or brought about in the world, must needs have a reason and understanding in some way or other, for they are all of them either voluntary or involuntary actions. And as for the things that are in heaven, they must also have some reason and understanding, although not so express and particular, as the reason and understanding of the things that are in the world.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless?
Fame is meaningless for the reason, that it doth not make one more wise, good, or virtuous, but doth but make one more proud, or more conceited of one’s own self. As the meanest man that lives, doth, upon a certain occasion, or by some special accident, attain to some sort of reputation: it is but for the time, it doth not give him any better understanding of the matter; it doth not make him either wiser or better, but merely doth make him more conceited.

So to be understood: that if a man do desire fame, and yet do wish to live wisely and virtuously; then the desire of fame doth oppose his desire to live wisely and virtuously. For it doth only tend to make one more conceited of himself, and doth not give one the better understanding of any matter.

Therefore, as long as we do not desire the fame of the world, we ought not to be troubled at the fame of others. And even so we ought not to be proud and conceited. For if we would be wise and virtuous; and if we would live in the right and honest way; then it doth not matter how many men there <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace and comfort
The nature of man is, not only capable of happiness, and pleasure, and delight, but also of pain, sorrow, and misery. A happy and contented mind, is such a mind as is pleased and satisfied with things as they are, and that is pleased and satisfied, when all things are in their proper order and season: that is, that is pleased and satisfied, as it is, according to its nature and constitution; that is, as it is, according to the nature and constitution of man; that is, according to the nature and constitution, that is according to the natural order of the world, and the natural order of nature itself. For it is not according to the natural order of man himself, that he should be pleased and satisfied. But it is according to the natural order of the world, and the natural order of nature itself, that it should be so. And therefore, if we have any peace and comfort, it is, as I said, according to the natural order of the world, and the natural order of nature itself. It is not according to the natural order of man, that we should be pleased and satisfied, but according to the natural order of the world, and the natural order of nature itself. It <END>

The wisdom of the ancient philosophers, which was acquired by much pain and toil, was very much impaired by their silence; for they were not willing to impart their wisdom unto any one, and therefore they were not willing to give an answer unto any question; and for the same reason they did not wish to speak. And in their silence, there was much discourse. For they could not speak otherwise, but by discoursing. The same reason is with some Christians. For the religious and religious professors of some of them, do think it an act of great piety, not to give a direct answer, or a direct reply to any question whatsoever; but rather to say, I cannot answer; I cannot give any account. This also may be added, that this silence was not unbecoming, nor unseemly; for that is of a truth that which is becoming and becoming of a man, is always to beget a certain grace and a certain dignity: and to that, their silence doth much concur; for they did not only not speak, but they did speak nothing.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger. (Of Cicero) [1]

To deal with anger, we ought to be of the same opinion in two things; either that anger is a natural motion, and that it is proper to have some respect for it, as for a natural affection. For even though the passion be unreasonable, it is no less natural than a reasonable affection is. And therefore we must not endeavour to extirp anger altogether, but rather to cure it, as one that is sickly. But let us not think that the physician's art hath power to remove this passion altogether.

Of anger, we have already spoken; and yet there is a great difference, how men manage and deal with anger, whether they seek to be free from it, or whether they are contented with it. For in the case of the former, there is great danger and uncertainty. But of the latter, there is no danger, but only trouble and vexation; for so much is there to be done, as to take heed of one's self, and to beware of the occasion of wrath, as of any other thing: and it is no other, but that which is proper and natural unto men; and so there is no harm in it, if only the mind be kept sober.

As to the nature of the universe, it is a subject of great doubt and uncertainty.

It is a thing of great doubt, how these elements should be combined together; that is, what is the true cause and reason of their combination. Is it a matter of natural motion; or some other cause? Or is it something else which doth cause the elements to combine together? As to these, I know not what I shall say, and to such matters, I am altogether a stranger, as far as it shall be possible for me to be.

The matter that doth unite the elements together, is that they are all in a state of motion, which, as I have said, is not to be understood in an absolute sense, that is to say, it is not that they move in a circle; for such is not their proper motion; but they move, as a particle of matter, and as a part of that general body, which is called the universe; <END>

As the only thing that is certain and eternal, is death, let us consider how we may make our lives in such a manner, as that our death may not be a punishment unto us, but an occasion of profit unto us. First then, we must know that death, is not only a separation of the soul from the body, but also a change and transmutation of it. That is, as we change, the flesh, into the blood; so also, do we change, the blood, into the spirit. And though this change is in some sense, an increase of life, yet is it not of the same kind that life was before; so that as for the life of the body, it is, for the time of our mortality, as a mere continuation or continuation of what was before: and as for the life of the soul, it is a new beginning or first appearance: so that as for the soul, it is, a new life.

As for the use and benefit of fame, it is, that it may raise a man, as far as to the degree of a god: and that it may put him in a capacity, to be as one of the gods. For a man, that is known and celebrated, is in a capacity, to be as one of the gods; and a man, that is beloved and beloved, is not far from being a god. For one that is beloved, is a man that is esteemed for his good qualities, and for those things, that are in him, which are excellent and good: and a man that is beloved, is one that is most dear to men, and most admired.

## Step 1:  Understand the context and purpose of the discourse.
The discourse is addressed to young women of a monastery and deals with the nature of anger and hatred. It is likely that the purpose is to guide them in how to deal with negative emotions, leading to a more virtuous and peaceful life.

## Step 2:  Identify the main ideas to be discussed.
The discourse likely addresses how to distinguish between anger and hatred, how to understand the causes and effects of these emotions, and how to cultivate peace and humility in the face of adversity.

## Step 3:  Analyze the likely structure of the discourse.
Given the topic, the discourse might follow a structure similar to the works of St. Francis de Sales, such as an exposition of a biblical passage or an application of a theological principle to real-life situations.

## Step 4:  Consider the author's perspective and the likely content of the discourse.

But since death is a thing that concerneth all men, and all things must pass away, we must either embrace it, or endeavour to shun it; and that as a part of those things, which we call good and fair, to embrace it as one of those things, and to embrace it for good. Now, what is good and fair, is to be known by their proper significations and interpretations. But death is a thing of a different kind. Death is, as I have said, the dissolution of a body, which is that, wherein we live. Now, how can a body be dissolved, and yet preserved in its whole substance; and yet preserve a part of its substance; that is, the soul? and how can the soul be preserved in its whole substance, and yet not be dissolved, or broken? <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is not to follow the crowd, but to lead the crowd.

This quote is a great example of the leadership philosophy of William Hazlitt, a British writer and orator. Hazlitt was a strong advocate for the importance of individual freedom and autonomy, and he believed that leaders should be willing to challenge the status quo and take bold action.

Hazlitt's philosophy is reflected in this quote because it emphasizes the need for leaders to be independent thinkers who can think for themselves and make decisions that are not beholden to popular opinion. This is in contrast to the more passive approach of many leaders, who tend to follow the crowd and conform to societal norms.

This quote has a number of key themes. The first is the idea of leadership, which is often associated with power and influence. However, Hazlitt's quote suggests that leadership is not just about exerting control over others, but about taking bold action and challenging the status quo. The second theme is the idea of autonomy and individuality, which is central to Hazlitt's philosophy. The quote suggests that true leadership is not about following the crowd, but about being able to think for oneself and make independent decisions. The third theme is the idea of freedom, which is closely related to autonomy and individuality <END>

In this particular case, as is usual,  we will endeavour, as much as we can, to judge.

And so after some time,  we will be able to give an account of them.  But  in the case of the two men, that were just now mentioned,  it is not in our power to give an account, of them at all.  For they are not yet disposed by themselves.  In the case of men and women,  of both sexes, it is very common for them to be of the same age.  And yet  there are some that are not.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
The world of social media can sometimes make it seem like everyone is a star, that is to say famous. Everyone is sharing their opinions, their experiences, their accomplishments, their feelings. And as a result, many people can give the impression of fame and influence, even when it is not so. However, as the saying goes, "fame is fleeting". Fame, or rather its equivalent, has been around for thousands of years. It was one of the first things that humans noticed, one of the first things that humans admired and envied. It is no wonder, for who does not want to be noticed, who does not want to be admired, and who does not want to be envied? And so, it is natural to look around at our friends and acquaintances, and wonder who they are, and what their story is. But, what about their true story? What about their real story?

As we look around, it is often the people we do not notice at all, who have a real story, a true story, a story of what really matters in life. They may not be the most glamorous, they may not be the most famous, they may not even be the most successful, but they do have a real story. And <END>

For by the right use and exercise of his natural faculties, and the keeping of himself in good order, a man shall ever be in peace. This is a point of great importance, and one that doth require a great deal of consideration. For unless a man is perfectly at ease and in peace, he can never be in a proper state of mind. But then, how can he be at ease and in peace, that are subject to such continual troubles and vexations as himself? But these troubles and vexations, are the result of their own ungodly lives and actions. For as the Psalmist says: "It is better to dwell in a lodge, than in a house of strangers, or a house of pride." For such is the nature of a pride. Therefore, as the Psalmist doth say, let us always keep in mind, that the things of this world are fleeting and transient, and that the things of heaven and of the soul are eternal and lasting.

Is it to be hoped that our understanding shall be capable to contain and preserve the multitude of the objects, which in a reasonable time of life, we do see in the world? Let us then not be ashamed to make use of that other common remedy, that which is called a history of the world. The object of such a history, is to make the reader sensible, that the whole of time, which we are now about to consider, is one continuous and uniform whole, so that the end and beginning of all things, is not one and the same, but many and several. And if the end of time be one and the same, it is not clear, how one and the same thing can be the beginning of another; which is a very strange and inexplicable thing.

The virtue of silence is not merely a matter of being silent; but also that of speaking and acting wisely, with a regard to the proper object. For when a man is silent, he is not merely silent; but he is also silent with a certain grace, and a certain discretion. And when he speaks, his words are not merely words, but words of a certain gravity and solemnity; and his actions are not merely actions, but actions of a certain gravity and solemnity. And as for that discretion and gravity, I say that they are not to be had, but by the grace of God; and that they are to be cherished and preserved, as they are. And this discretion and gravity, I say, that they are not to be had, but by the grace of God; and that they are to be cherished and preserved, as they are; and that they are to be imitated, both by those who desire to live well, and by those who desire to die well.

Pain is not the same as suffering. The one refers to the nature of the thing, and the other to the will or consent of the one who suffers. Of things, some are not able to endure pain at all, and are sensible only of pleasure and pain in general. And this is true of those things only which are not substantial beings. Of those things which are substantial, some are able to endure pain, some are not. And some of them are even able to bear a great many pains, and to endure long periods of pain. The one is of the kind that can bear many things without any fear. And the other is of a kind which is able to endure many pains for a short time, and so also many long periods. Of those things which can endure many pains, and many long periods, some are of the kind that are able to endure many things without any fear, and some are not. Of those things which are able to endure many things without any fear, some are of the kind that are able to endure many pains, and so many long periods.

What else is the end of human life, which is but one ordinary life and conversation of man? Of this they that have not such a common life and conversation, do not speak of their end or object; for they have none otherwise to speak of.

It was thus: "If it be so, that the world doth seem to be governed and disposed, as if there were no other principle in it, than that of reason; and that it be the duty and proper business of all men, who have understanding, to apply themselves, and use all their understanding and reason, in all their actions and dealings, as it shall be most reasonable and prudent, and according unto the laws of nature; and that it be also the duty of the wise and prudent, to do as many good deeds, and actions, as the occasion may require and permit; and that all men may have good opinions, and good words, of one another: and that men should also have a due regard, to the laws, and rules of nature; and to the lawes of the land, and commonweal; and to the lawes <END>

Now this question is, as I have already said, a true universe. For to have a universe, is that which we have already said, to be all things, or the whole. For I call this the whole, because, of all things, in respect of quantity, there is nothing which, is greater, or which doth surpass all others, and there is nothing, that doth stand beyond, or over all, and all is subject unto one. But of these things, is there not already, as I said, a true whole? That is to say, a world? Or as of one thing, that doth all, or which doth all, is that thing, which, of all things, is greater?

<BEGIN> How to face death in a positive and healthy way

Death is a natural part of life. Everyone will die one day. A person's attitude towards death and its approach is what really matters.

If a person can face death positively and healthily, that can lead to a very positive change in the world and make that person a happy man in the end.

What is the way of facing death positively?

The best way to face death positively and healthily is to be fully satisfied with all that has been given to us. To be fully satisfied and contented with what we have is what matters most.

If we are fully contented with all we have, then death would be the most wonderful thing that can happen. Death is the end of our suffering, it is the end of our misery.

Death is not the end of our knowledge and understanding of the world, death is not the end of our experience. We will never know, how much we really know. How much we really understand. How much we really experience.

Death is not the end of our actions, death is not the end of our works.

We must teach them not only the things necessary to the present life, but also those which may serve them for all time to come.
And yet, how contrary to this nature is that of a tyrant, which is to do all possible evil. To do all possible evil is the greatest tyranny and oppression of all, and that which is most opposite to the very nature of a good king, and to that which is most natural for a leader, which is to do their best for the good of all, and to promote their happiness.
Thus we see that the difference between good and bad is not so much in what they say or do, as in what they do: and in the nature of their actions. The one is natural, and the other is against nature.

On the contrary, that the things which are known, may be comprehended within a very narrow compass; for they are not many, and not difficult to understand. For as the mind, after it is well trained, can in very little time comprehend whatsoever things are taught to it, so in the same manner those things which are comprehended under one general principle, can be understood in a very little time. And when the mind is once well acquainted with a few general principles, all other things can be understood in a very little time. For as one general proposition can be understood, by the help of one or more particular propositions; so a particular proposition, can be understood, by the help of a general proposition or several particular propositions. And in the same manner, the whole science, may be understood, by the help of one or more particular propositions, and some general propositions. For the whole science is not a general proposition; but a whole body of particular propositions; which may be comprehended under one general proposition.

For man is a reasonable creature, and therefore of such a disposition, that either he cannot help, or must help, what he doth speak. Either by way of natural understanding, or by way of grace. For either he doth speak naturally, as in his own way and proper, as the earth doth move by her own proper motion; or as is the case with some animals. But if it be by grace, it is either by grace from God, or by grace of some particular thing in man. For grace in God, is that which he doth give, to be a good man.

In his book, "A Discourse upon a Common Man," Thomas Browne says: "But, forsooth, we are not as others, in sooth, we are not of that world; we are of a better world; we are of that world of angels, and blessed spirits; and the common man, that is but a flesh and blood man, is not worthy of our respect and consideration."

How much the things that happen, are subject to change; and how little the things themselves are subject to change. A man's heart is the same, and his actions the same, in sooth; though outwardly it may be changed. And of what use is it to us, if it be only changed?

Fame, though it be called a thing eternal, and perpetual, and unending, is in reality a thing very transitory, and ephemeral, and short-lived. And if thou desirest a true happiness, and a true content, look not upon that which is called a fame. For, if that be all, that thou desirest, that is not a true and proper desire.

In what is called the world, all things are subject to the same rule: that everything is changed, and put in different places; <END>

And so it is either of two; that it is finite; that it is infinite. It is finite; it is infinite: either of these two it is: either of these two it is.

And so it may be said, that whatsoever man doth, he doth either wisely or foolishly. Whether his actions be governed by any one of those things, by reason of his natural constitution; or by some accident, or by some action that may have been wrought by some other; or, as the very best of men say, by some divine providence. For if man had been originally created, and yet he had never done anything which was either right or wrong, that would be a true miracle. But, as it is, all men, in the course of time, have committed some action that is either right or wrong. And that action, either by itself, or in conjunction with some other, hath caused, either for themselves, or for some other, some hurt or injury.

It is better, therefore, to consider what it is that is to be done in this case: not that the anger should be put out of the way. For the way of angering is not in the body. It is a thing that doth pass and come in; but the way of it, being in the mind, must be cured and healed. The cure of this is, not to be grieved at any thing. For if any man is grieved at any thing, and that also with a bitter sorrow and a sullen temper, he is angry.

And that the cure of this also is, not to be grieved at any thing, which I have already said: for anger is nothing else, but grieving and sullenness, or rather, sullenness itself.

To achieve this, it is necessary for them to have knowledge. However, knowledge is not gained by listening to many men. For when many are present, they will give many opinions. But opinions are not what is true. What is true is what is best, and best is what is for the good of all. But the good of all can only be known to God, and no man knows what is for the good of all.
This argument, therefore, is not of a simple and reasonable nature; for it doth not hold. But if any man would argue thus, he must be blind indeed, or a simple fool. For he that is wise, will consider not the opinions of many, but the truth itself. But he that is ignorant, will think that a wise man doth consider the opinions of many, and the truth of the matter.

When reason is once awakened, and a man beginneth to understand and conceive things, the knowledge of truth, the understanding of causes and effects, the true principles of the universe, and the power, efficacy, and majesty of God, are all his due. For they are the true principles and causes of all things, which by reason and knowledge are understood.
In the nature of man, there is nothing so peculiar and proper, that is, not common to many animals, as the faculty of reasoning and ratiocination. And though it be not the only faculty of the soul, yet is it so proper and proper to it, that it is hardly conceivable that the soul should ever be without it.
The power and efficacy of reason are so great, that nothing is able to stand against them, except a wicked and contrary will. A man, that is truly willing to know the truth, is so far from opposing the power and efficacy of reason, that he is able to apply and exercise it, that he may be able to discern truth from falsehood, and to follow the truth unto the end.

When I went out to dinner, I was as soon as possible out of the room, that no one might be able to tell me, and to know what I said or did, and that, being able to see and know all, I should be a great while in the telling of it, and never come to pass. But, as the Lord hath pleased, I shall soon be out of this world. My son, I know thou shalt go down into Egypt. I pray that thou mayest be preserved and preserved from harm. The Lord shall protect thee. Do not go out to strangers. Do not take anything in hand, unless thou canst do it with all speed. Be not afraid of death. It is but death. What thou hast to do, do it; and be not afraid of it. Be not afraid of death, lest thou mayest come unto it. For God, who created all things, doth preserve all things; and we all have the Lord, who hath power over all things.

Why is a tree like a ship that navigates the seas, or a horse that gallops the plains, but not so much a human? Why, indeed, do I not even think of that one thing, which is a common property to all of them? To be the first that any thing is in the world. What can be a more honourable condition? Yet, it is clear, that to be the first is a very contemptible thing, for in the first of all things, that which is first in the world, and before all other things, is death. For the whole of what we do in our lives is a continuance from one death unto another; and this continuance, and this succession of death, is that one thing, which is first in all things.
This is a very important passage. From the nature of things, all things must have an end, and therefore the continuance and succession of death is a thing of a very noble and honourable sort. Why? Why, because, without death there could be no life at all, and without succession of death, there could be no continuance of life, and therefore no life at all.

This passage reflects a desire to cultivate inner peace and freedom from distractions and disturbances, as a foundation for living a Christian life. It highlights the importance of seeking forgiveness and a good conscience, which is a central theme in Christianity. Matthew Henry, an English theologian and biblical commentator, was known for his insightful and thought-provoking writings, and this passage exemplifies his style. As the passage reflects, true inner peace is not something that can be found in the world, but only in <END>

<BEGIN> On the passage of time, and the way of the world.

But this thou must not forget, that the time of all times, is the time of the universe, or all the worlds together: and in it thou must find all things that can be conceived; that is, the very nature of things: for which the mind, even by itself, doth in time, find itself; and doth perceive in its own course, the things which are about it.

As the sun shineth, the moon, the stars, the planets, and the air, doth it so that it should not be known, that there is a universe? As it doth so, that in that universe there should be worlds, that it should not be known, that there are worlds?

To speak properly and honestly, is that which doth truly pass for the speech of an angel.

And thou must always be so careful, as that thou never sayest anything that can give a man occasion of conceiving, that thou are a hypocrite, or an impostor; that thou either dost not believe, what thou sayest, or dost not think, what thou doest; or that either the world is altogether corrupt, and nothing good doth it: or that there is nothing at all in <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is that it is more pleasant to hear of those who are silent, and those who are not, than to speak themselves of those who are silent.
For as many as are silent, they do it of a good mind and for the better good. And as many as do speak of them, do so not of a good mind, but either out of envy, or a desire to hinder. And as many as hear of those who are silent, they do so out of a good mind; and many others do so out of a bad mind. The former, being moved by the love and affection of those who are silent, do hear of them as it were out of charity: but the latter, being moved by their hatred, do hear of them as if by ill will. And those, that do not hear of those who are silent, they either do not know, or are altogether careless and unminded. For they do not hear, that either the things themselves be true or false: but they either do believe the contrary of what is said, or they do believe it as if it were true. And so they either do the contrary of what is truly good: or they do not take heed. And if they do not take heed, and do the contrary, <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain. One who is of the school of Stoicism, is able to bear with equanimity the greatest of sufferings; and his heart is not troubled, either by any outward trouble, or any inward perturbation. This also, and all those things which are not of our own making, must be endured patiently. And one who is of a virtuous mind, shall always think well, and of a good opinion of himself; and his mind shall be full of good counsel; and one who is of a virtuous mind, and is one of the sect of Stoics, and is also a wise and reasonable man, is not disturbed at any outward thing. His heart, therefore, is not moved or troubled. For as to the nature of a man, as the Stoics believe, it is not much changed by external things. A man may also bear his pain with great equanimity. He must be one who is accustomed to bear it well. And therefore, one who is well accustomed to endure pain, and is not moved by any external thing, is a good man. But, that one may bear pain well, there are three things necessary. Firstly, he must have a good opinion of himself; secondly, he must be free from all super <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life
Consider all that is past, from the beginning of man; and take account of the whole time of it, and of all the things that are there; and when it shall please thee, pass the rest of it: but now for once only, take heed not of all, that is past. For what is past, that is truly past, is already done; and can by no means return again; so that we have no cause to be grieved or sorrowful about any thing, that is past: and so it will be with all those things, which are future also; but so as not yet to be. And so let us have a cheerful and pleasant spirit; and mind not that which is past, but that which is future. (Cotton, p. 13.)

— Or perhaps — not. (Cotton, p. 13.)

These words are the true way to pass through all things, in an easy and pleasant manner; and if it is a hard matter, to say what things are truly past, and what are truly future, so it is also hard to say what things are truly now.

— Or, if thou wilt, say what things are truly now: for what is truly now is truly past: and that is <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger, the ancient Greeks were said to have had some better wisdom than the present generation: for the mere passion of anger is not of itself so much a matter of justice or injustice, as a mere thing of sense; and of sense, of a bad sense; for it doth hinder man from discerning the true relations of things, and from taking such measures as are fit for the preservation and happiness of his life. And if any man be angry with another, what shall he do? The first thing, that he must do, is to understand himself and his own state, as being not otherwise than a man, subject to the same infirmities and imperfections that are common unto all men. For he that is angry, is not angry with the particular person that he is angry at, but with all that are of one mind or kind with that person. And that which is commonly spoken of anger, is but a general hatred; and of hate, but a general malice. Now for the first part of this discourse, let us consider how a man that is angry, may first understand himself, and his own state, in regard of the nature of man.

Firstly, let us consider, what it is that is common to all men. Now it is <END>

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe, the mind is accustomed to ponder, and to seek out the secrets which are hid in nature. We find that nature is full of secrets, and that, therefore, we are apt to seek after them. For of the secrets of nature, some are indeed hid from us, and which, therefore, can never be known by us. Of those that are known, some are hidden from the view of the understanding, and are only known by reason. Of those that are known and visible, and can be brought to our view and understanding, some are hid from our view and understanding, as soon as they are discovered. For this very thing is, that some things which are known to the universe, are yet unknown to us. And those that are not known to the universe, yet are known to us, are things of such a nature, that they are not understood by any rational mind. For of those things which are understood by some rational minds, some are of such a nature, that they cannot be comprehended by our understanding; and some are of such a nature, that they cannot be comprehended by any rational mind whatsoever. Therefore we are to seek after those things, which are either known to the universe, and yet not known to us, or are known <END>

<BEGIN> On logic and reason, he was not so skilled as in poetry. He had a good imagination, but he had not much use for his imagination. He did not take pains to learn the language of the Egyptians, and so could not apply all that knowledge of their language that was in his mind. He did not know any thing of the history of Egypt; nor had he any knowledge of the bodies and motions of the stars: but he had a good imagination of their appearance to the naked eye. He had an excellent mind, and a good memory: but not a very good understanding: nor was he well skilled in any one subject; nor was he much addicted to philosophical discourses: neither did he read or teach any one of the ancient philosophers. (St. Augustine)
This passage is characteristic of the ancient Stoics, who were more inclined to cultivate their minds in the way of speculation, and to be conversant with abstract truth and reason, than those of the later period, who were more practical and applied. It is also characteristic of St. Augustine, who, as a Christian, had been inculcated to value reason above all other things; and to esteem it, as the true and faithful servant of God; and the principal and chief end of all human actions and endeavors <END>

<BEGIN> On the behavior of others
All the world, all human creatures, are under a general necessity of doing what is just, and right: and are subject to a general power or authority; that is to say, to a power or authority of a kind, and of a sort, that is common unto all, and that doth regulate their actions, and governs their lives, unto their very last breaths.

If we would therefore consider the nature of those things, that we do, or omit, as they are the common actions of mankind, and as they are all subject to this common power, or authority; we must consider also the power and authority, that is over those things, and over those who do them.

And the power and authority, that is over the world, is none other than that of God.

Therefore let us not think of a way, by which we may escape the power and authority of God.

For what is the use of the power and authority of God, and of the common power and authority, over all mankind, is to make them to see, and to understand, and to believe that which is just and right, and which is according to his own nature and will.

And therefore, let us rather speak of the things, which are according to his <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless in life.
In today’s world, where fame is the goal of many, and the most sought-after career path is a celebrity, most people find themselves struggling with their identity. Why do they pursue this path when it is so fleeting and ephemeral? Why do they waste their time on fame when it is the least of human desires? What does a life of fame achieve? Does it make us happy? Does it make us wise? Does it make us kind?

A wise man, a truly wise man, does not seek after fame. For fame is a mere name, a mere label that can never satisfy. It is a mere show, a mere pretension. It is a mere thing, a mere word. It is not a thing that can do anything.

Why then did the world create these idols? And why do they call these things good? Do they know the nature of these things, and are they wise? No, they know not, they are fools.

And what is fame but an idol? A false thing, that is, and a vain thing? It is an idol, a thing that doth pretend to be a god, but is not a god.

It is a false thing, a mere show. A mere pretension, that do <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace in a world filled with strife, we must first turn inwards.
For in that we find, there is no strife. In the inward light of God, all is well. This is a true and certain matter. But, the world is a sea of darkness, and it is impossible to discern the depths thereof, by the light of the sun. And this is true; for who can discern the depth, and the nature of the water, by the light of the sun alone? So we must look unto the Lord, as unto the fountain, and the well spring, which doth overflow into the sea.
But, if thou dost look unto any creature, as unto the fountain of life, it is false; and thy labour and travail, will be to no purpose.
For the creature, is a mere instrument, and a means. And when it hath fulfilled its end, it is cast aside, and becomes a dung. For there is no creature, but as an instrument, and as a thing of nought, which doth not become nothing, and perisheth.
So thou must look unto the Lord, and the Lord only; for this is the fountain of life; and this is the source and the spring, from which all things flow, and which <END>

<BEGIN> On the passage of time
We see the whole world move swiftly along, and many of those things which we are wont to cherish, are speedily consumed by time and decay. They, which have a natural life, as men, or the creatures of God's creation, live in such a manner as their nature requires; but they, who are of the number of things that are born of other, are brought to the point, where their own decay begins, and in a little while, are no more.

When, therefore, a man, after a time, doth leave the world, he leaves the world which doth move; and that which he has brought about by his own act, shall soon be brought about, and shall be consumed, in the same manner. And what man soever he be, or what creature, that ever doth come into existence, is but a fleeting moment. This, then, is the passage of time.

The only thing to which the mind is fixed, is the mind itself, and this it doth in its own proper time and way, make use of, and bring unto its own end, and as it is, doth in its own proper time, make use of and bring unto its own end. And that which in this world <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is so much the same with the virtue of speaking, that some have thought that one is the same thing with the other; as if it were not the same thing to be silent, and not to be able, or unwilling; and to speak, and speak not, but be able to speak; or that the one virtue consists in this, that either to speak, or not to speak, is a thing of right and necessity.
But yet, though it be the same thing to speak and not to speak; yet is the one of the two, of greater and better use and disposition, that they should speak rather than be silent. For how long and frequently soever any man is silent, his silence is the longer and more frequent: whereas, how long and frequently soever any man speaketh, that is not his fault, and doth not speak by constraint of any thing, but by nature, and proper inclination of his mind, is that which he speaketh, both of use and of beauty.
For this reason, it is reasonable to say, that the virtue of speaking, and the virtue of silence, is one and the same; but of different kindes and dispositions. For a man that can speak well, but cannot be silent, is a <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain.
Enduring a great pain for a considerable time, or till it be over, is that which is properly called endurance of pain. The other things, which are sometimes called pain, and other times pains, are either mere distastes of the organs, or mere passions of the soul. Of pain itself, some speak of it, and some do not. This is that which the Stoics are accustomed to call pain. But, when we say that pain is something, which is hateful or offensive, the Stoics seem not to have said a word of it. But this, which we call pain, to the Stoics is pain. For as a man, if he be troubled with any disease, which he doth not like, or with any pain, which he doth not like, is not he pained? How then shall we speak of pain, if it be not pain, in what other way, but that of the Stoics? Of which now we shall speak. For their definition, of pain, we have already spoken. But now we shall speak, of that, which they called a pleasure. They say, that pleasure is the absence of pain. Or rather, that it is the cessation of pain. For the absence of pain, and <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life: An imitation of the very same fop who wrote that famous passage, That fop had in his mind, that he had in his short life to do a great many things, and to spend his short time very busily. But that he might not, the while he was doing his business, he would give his head up to him, who had his head bent down. In that he was not altogether unlike some, who think they shall live, when they do live only but one day. Or, indeed, what man that has a mind to live and to be happy, ought he to do, but to live, to be happy? The fop's opinion, as some men will call it, is not true at all; that is, that a man's shortness is a great occasion of his happiness: but, indeed, it is the very contrary. The shortness of life is, that it is a very great occasion of a man's misery: but what a man is happy, in any reasonable time, he is not so much a man, but a reasonable man. What a man is happy, in a reasonable time, is indeed very rare indeed, for the whole compass of human life is not sufficient for us to do that one thing <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger
To deal with anger is to deal with a matter of a great and urgent nature; but, in a manner, to put out of mind. For anger is an angry spirit, and an angry temper, and an angry mind. To put anger out of mind, is to remove the irritation of it, and to turn the mind towards the one thing that doth belong to a peaceful and a gentle spirit: the one thing, the one true God.
By and by, thou shalt be able to bear the affronts of others, with a merry and good humour, and to answer them in a reasonable and gentle way. Thou shalt find thyself a very merry and pleasant fellow, and in all the company of men, thou shalt be the happiest and the most cheerful man of all. For anger, and wrath, and pride, are all against the rule of all reasonable and human creatures; but happiness and pleasure, and a merry spirit, are all upon the rule of them. This also is true, that if thou wilt deal with anger, as I have taught thee, thou shalt have more confidence and a more clear conscience; because all those things that are of a doubtful nature, shall be cleared up. And also, thou shalt be more contented and happy <END>

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe
We do not know that we live in a universe. If we do not know this, how can it be possible for us to know that we do not live in one. We must know that it is not so, and if it be so, we must also know that we do not know it. So then in either case we must know that we do not live in one. And as the question is not, whether it is possible for us to know, whether it is possible for us to know, whether it is possible for us to know, that we do not live in one; but how it is possible that we do live in one, which is not a matter of possibility, and yet of which the nature is such that it is impossible that it should be otherwise. Let us then speak properly of the nature of the universe; and that which is commonly received to be true, and which all men of good understanding and observation, and such as are able to judge properly, have found to be true. It is a matter of the common knowledge, that there are some things that are not subject to change, or are not subject to the changes of time; and of such things, there is none that is better, or that doth better deserve to be <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death with courage.
Courage is not the absence of fear. But the willingness to fear and to act in spite of fear. How should this be done? Let this be thy principle. Be always mindful that the present hour is the only time thou shalt have. The fear of death, then, is but the fear of what is yet to come. Let it be, then, that it shall come soon; and that thy own end shall not be long delayed. But this is not possible: that is not in our power. But let it be thy purpose, that as soon as death shall be come unto thee, thou shalt have had the time to live, as long as is proper, and as is necessary. Or, as the Stoics would say, as long as is proper and fitting. For that is the true and proper end of every man, that he may live to his own season and time. And then to die with that courage and tranquillity of mind, which thou mayest also get, for thy own part, if thou will be content to live in the same manner as others, and not to seek any extraordinary honour, nor glory, nor power. The first thing is, that thou shouldst desire nothing. Then next, that thou should <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is not to be hated for. So much is this the case, that if a man will be hated for, his duty should be to be loved. The cause of all this hatred, that men have against those that are leaders, is that they are hated by some of their subjects; and the cause of their hatred, by some of them, is, that they have neglected the welfare of their subjects. Forsooth, to be a leader is to be a public father unto men; and a public father, a public nurse: for they have the charge of many, and care of them: and care of them is the same thing with duty, and duty is the same thing with love. A father, a public father, a leader, and a public nurse; all these things do in kind, and in effect, one another. And as for a man's being hated by some of his subjects; this is, I suppose, to be expected: because all men, that are subject unto a king, do love and obey, not only as a matter of duty, but also as a matter of honour, and as a matter of natural affection. And when they do not, their cause is, that they are either corrupted by some wicked humour; or that <END>

<BEGIN> On logic and reason: In the former, which deals with common things, and matters that affect all men, as the laws of nature, and the constitution of the universe, he who is ignorant of these things, is not only unlearned, but even a fool; whereas, in the latter, which deals with the particular circumstances of man, and the accidents and contingencies of life, he may be ignorant of those things, which are necessary for him to know, and yet be no fool.
[From the Commentaries of Epictetus.]

The principles and axioms, which have been from time to time received and adopted, and now are the foundation of the whole system, and the very pillars and supports of it, are these: the principle of identity, the principle of contradiction, and the principle of excluded middle. To these principles we must refer all our arguments and syllogisms, and we must be able to resolve all our doubts and questions into those very principles; for otherwise it would be a mere matter of words, and mere trifling.

Be not content, unless thou have a true and full understanding of all those things, which in themself doth and ought to operate.  And further, if thou canst, do always act, as thou hast learned and understood. For that which is true and well grounded, and in itself consistent, cannot but produce true and well grounded actions, and all things that are pertinent and conected to it, to act and operate properly and well.  But if thou art able, as the saying is, "that it be for the general good; therefore it must be that it be true and true for the most part. For what is general, cannot but be true for the most part.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
In today's celebrity culture, many of us can't help but idolize those who have achieved great success and recognition in their field. We marvel at their accomplishments, and we're eager to know the secrets to their success. We see them as role models, and we wish we could be like them.

But here's the thing: fame is not as great as it seems. In fact, many people who have achieved great success and recognition would argue that it's actually been a curse.

Take, for example, the story of Paris Hilton. At just 18 years old, she became a media sensation, appearing on a popular reality show and making headlines as a wealthy and glamorous young woman. But in recent years, she's spoken out about the negative effects of fame on her life, saying that it made her feel lonely and isolated, even though she had a million dollars to spend on friends and experiences.

Or look at the case of Chris Brown, the rapper who was once one of the most promising young artists in the game. But after a series of high-profile controversies and violent outbursts, his star began to fade, and he's now struggling to make a comeback.

So why do we idolize celebrities, when they so often lead such troubled lives? One <END>

To have a good understanding, is a great part of the true end of the body.
To have a good understanding, and to be able to reason well, and to use thy mind in the way of wisdom, is a great part of the true end of the body.

Of the nature of the mind; and the way of its operation.
The nature of the mind, is such, as to have its seat and subsistence, in the whole body, or in some part of the body, as the brain; and the whole body, as the soul.
The mind is the principal part, of all understanding; and that of all faculties, and powers.

He that doth not remember, doth not remember anything. But he that doth remember, doth remember all things. The remembrance of all things, is not only a natural power, but an especial gift of God.
But yet the memory, being the very instrument, through which we do remember and hold in remembrance, is not a power in itself, but an instrument in the hands of that power, that is, in the hands of God, which doth operate by means of it. It is a part of that power, which is able to make men, and things, to remember. It is an instrument of that power, which can make men and things to forget. It is a means of that power, which can make men to forget themselves. It is a part <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain and discomfort

The end of life is a solemn occasion for all who are present. A good end is what all should desire; and so, if it be the end of the present life, let us be satisfied, if it be a good and godly end. As for the other things of this life, that are not necessary to our salvation, and are but common and temporal things, let us not be much disturbed about them; for it is a common thing with men, to be troubled about such things; but the chief thing, is to make peace with God, and to keep that peace. If all things go well with all men, it is better than a great deal of anything; but if the contrary, it is better than the contrary: for what is good, is good; and what is bad, is bad. He who shall truly do his duty, shall do it to God's glory. He who shall truly love his neighbour, shall love him for God's sake. He who shall truly preach, shall preach for God's sake. He who shall truly pray, shall pray for God's sake. He who shall truly be patient, shall be patient for God's sake. He who shall truly forgive, shall forgive for God's sake. He <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life and the certainty of its end, it is worth while to look back and to ponder thereon. For in a common way and without any special consideration, men are apt to forget that they are mortals: to think that the world is old, and that a time is come for them to leave it; but when they have time and opportunity so to do, they should rather ponder upon the shortness, and uncertainty of it. For there is nothing that can so easily pass over, as a short time; and there is nothing that can be so easily gotten over, as a uncertain death; and there is nothing that can be so easily forgot, as that which will happen when I shall have no further occasion for it. The first and chief part of a good life, is a good conscience; the second part of a good life, is the second part of a good conscience. What is a second conscience? It is the conscience which is not the first. The first is that which is produced by a good and upright disposition, that is to say, a good and upright mind. The second, it is that which is produced by the memory. This memory, I say, of such things as are past. For when it is a matter of memory, that we <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger. A short meditation.

How doth a man's heart ever come to be so enraged that he is not ashamed? It is for want of understanding; for they that understand not, cannot understand why their anger should be such. For it is as an unnatural action. A man is not angry when he hath time, but in such haste that he can find no time to think. He is not angry at that time, which he would have been angry of. Nay, it is not in his power to be angry at that time, because that is his own time: and that he is angry of, is another man's time, and one that is not his own.

In all men that are rationally disposed, there is an end of anger.

What is it that thou art angry about? What is that thing that thou dost bear a grudge against? Thou must understand it. If thou dost not understand, thou canst not be angry. It is not angry to be ignorant.

What is it that thou wouldst be contented with? What is that thing that thou wouldst be satisfied with? Thou must be contented with something, and satisfied with something. For thou art a rational creature.

And thus is it in the universe; the whole universe of things is but a large animal, or a large machine of many parts; all of them are in a natural order; and, when they are well disposed and well adjusted in their natural order, the whole machine itself is well disposed and well adjusted.

These quotations demonstrate that the human capacity for reason is considered essential for philosophical or intellectual pursuits.

We may define a rational animal as that which, by its own power, and without any external aid, doth apprehend and understand the things that are. (Thomas Aquinas)
According to Aristotle, an animal is rational if it can reason, meaning that it can think, reason and understand the things around it, i.e. its environment.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless in modern times

Fame is a fleeting thing, and its value is short-lived. It is a source of pride for some, but a source of pain and humiliation for many. Many people who have become famous in their field are often not even satisfied with it. They have no time to think about their own lives, they are all the time in a hurry.

A great poet once wrote, 'what do I care? If it were not so, I would not be here. I am a man. I must live. I must eat, I must sleep, I must be contented.'

In the modern age, one would naturally be drawn to fame. However, what is it that fame is? A piece of paper with a few words scribbled on it, a title that one has received. These things are of little value, and do not bring us any true happiness or satisfaction. In fact, they often do the opposite. They lead to envy and malice towards those who are not as famous. They make us proud, and that is a false pride, and it will only bring us sorrow and pain.

If fame were truly a good and noble thing, then it would be a source of comfort and joy, and not a source of pain and <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain in the face of an inevitable fate
is the very essence of the Stoic nature.

— Marcus Aurelius

The Stoics were a school of philosophy based in ancient Greece and Rome, founded by Zeno of Citium (334–263 BCE). The Stoics were characterized by their rigorous skepticism. In Stoic philosophy, the universe is an ordered system of natural law and necessity. The goal is to live in harmony with that nature. A Stoic is a rational being that understands his own place in the natural order. The universe is governed by reason, and so must be man's actions and thoughts. In his actions and thoughts, he must seek the common good and the well-being of all men, and avoid everything that may hinder or hinder this. In the Stoic view of human nature, human beings have an inherent tendency to rationalize. Rational beings are not only rational, but they are also endowed with an inalienable nature. The Stoic idea of man is therefore one of reason and intellect. A Stoic must, therefore, seek to attain the highest form of intellectual power, the highest power of intellect.

If you cannot get away, then get to a distance, as much as you can, from that man or woman, without offending them. Next, when the anger is gone, speak it out, and tell it, that it may not remain in thy heart, but may be thrown out, and that it may not do hurt again, but be used only to do good.

Aristotle is called a natural philosopher. And though his particular method, and particular objects of study, may have differed from those of others, we may observe that it is always such.

To be contented and quiet, is the greatest part of good. Let us then strive to be contented and quiet; let us not be hasty and impetuous, and not be carried away with the passion and fury of the world. For in those things, that are done with a willing heart and a gentle disposition, is true honour, and is the true measure of a man's honour. He who is willing and gentle in his actions, shall be respected and loved, and shall be worthy of it. But he, who is hasty and impetuous, and who doth bear his wrath and anger in his actions, shall be feared and hated.

But that also we may not forget, that it is not so easy to keep our own state and constitution, as we are wont to think, but is a thing very difficult, and hard to be kept. Therefore it is, that those are not easily saved, that do not strive to keep it up. For it is the same with all things, that that cannot be easily kept up, that is very hard. For example, a man that doth keep a large garden, and many cattle: what is the use of all this? He cannot enjoy it himself: or if he do enjoy it, what good is it? It doth bring him care, and trouble, and cost. But if he keep not all these things, and do his part, and be content, and humble, and put himself in a readiness to have his due: he shall enjoy all the better, and be much happier.

It is a virtue, both rare and excellent; and I would have it to be, as rare as any other, so it be, not useless. For it is not so much the speaking, as the being silent. For this virtue, there are many, that are more fit for it, than are able, and willing, to speak; for they are, by nature, more reserved, and backward; and so they are more apt to be silent.

Anger is a natural feeling, but when it is not managed properly, it can cause problems in personal and professional relationships, mental health, and overall well-being. Effective management of anger is important. It involves recognizing that anger is a natural emotion and dealing with it in a constructive manner.
Understanding anger is not an easy task, but a start is made when we understand the underlying causes. It is also necessary to recognize the differences between anger, frustration, resentment, and hostility. Anger is a strong emotion characterized by an intense feeling of annoyance, displeasure, and resentment. Anger is different from frustration, resentment, and hostility. Anger is an emotion that is directly related to the stimulation of a specific stimulus that is perceived as an attack or threat. Frustration is related to a person's inability to achieve a desired goal. Resentment is related to feelings of resentment and indignation. Hostility is related to a strong sense of animosity. There are many different causes for anger.
Anger can be a source of energy or motivation for the individual. Anger can also be a source of creative inspiration and artistry.
Effective anger management requires effective communication, anger expression, relaxation, problem solving, and empathy.

<BEGIN> On finding peace of mind: I have found that the greatest impediment to peace of mind is not the presence of trouble itself, but the manner in which we take it; not the thing, but the way. This is the same with all things that do disturb us. For even as a stone does not disturb a stone, but a heavy fall of snow, and a soft wind; so is it not the thing itself that doth trouble us, but the manner of it. Therefore, I pray thee, let us be careful to consider and reflect upon the way. Let it be known unto all men that it is not the matter, but the manner of it, that doth trouble and distract us, that we may take heed to avoid it, and not to take it so, as it doth come, and to avoid all those things, that doth bring us to distractions. We must not therefore, take it so, as it doth come; for it is not so, that it doth come. We must therefore take it in such a manner, as that it doth come; which is, that it is not so, that it doth come; for it is not so, that it doth come; for it is so, that it do <END>

<BEGIN> On the passage of time. A poem
by Henry Vaughan.

In the end, as in the beginning, all things do come to their pass.

A man who hath not in his heart and understanding the true nature of the world, and the end and purpose of his own existence, and the way of his own redemption, cannot possibly be contented, and satisfied, with his present state; but must always be desirous of that, which is yet to come.

This is the natural estate and condition of every man.

And therefore, as it were, out of their own proper natures, and motions, they do proceed, and advance, as far as their natural course will carry them; and as they do so, their thoughts are all about their next proceeding; their minds are all bent on that which is yet to come.

And this very thing is, that as a river doth flow, and as a tree doth grow, so also the soul doth advance and progress.

And that which doth advance a man, or carry him along, is that which is eternal, and which doth move and act upon all things, both that which is spiritual, and that which is material.

The soul's true nature, is not to rest and stay, but to advance and <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence.
What is it to be silent? How it is to be received and received in sooth, if one be wise; how detestable, and how vile, if a man be simple and unlearned.

They that speak, and those that speak not, are both bound to be just; but the one to give, and the other to receive the benefit of the just. For they that speak, are bound, as I said, to be just; and yet they do many things contrary unto the law of nature, and contrary unto justice.

They that speak, are bound unto the law of nature, that is to say, unto the law of love. For to love, and to speak well, and to speak the truth, is the same thing. And those that speak not, are also bound unto that law, that is to say, unto the law of love, in this respect, that they are silent, not for the sake of their own idleness, or sloth; but for the sake of some one or other; either for the sake of their own conscience, or for the sake of the conscience of another. And for what is that, but for the sake of the law of love?

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger and patience
When thy patience is put to the proof, and thou art in a manner put out of all reason and measure, consider this. When the rage is upon, then do thy best to be in patience and good reason. For if it is not so, that rage shall consume thee up, and it is not possible for it to be so good again.

Take heed therefore, that when anger and angerousness doth come upon thee, then be in patience, and good reason: as thou wouldst thyself be in the same case with another. For if any one comes to thee with anger, and thou dost not deal with him patiently, thou art no better than he. And if any man is put out of all patience and reason, and is enraged and angry, he is no better than any other man, and a true contemptible wretch, and one that doth nothing but despise and contempt his neighbours.

A plague upon them both, who can do nothing but despise and contempt their neighbours, and who can do nothing but despise and contempt their own selves. For such men are truly contemptible wretches.

But to deal with anger, and with patience, that is a thing of great difficulty. Therefore be of good courage <END>

And he doth not exercise his authority either by force and violence, or by any other manner than by persuasion and entreaty, and by the means of love and affection, and by the use of those means which are proper to the office of a leader and of a parent.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless, and how it can be used as a tool for good.
In a world where fame is highly coveted, many individuals seek to become famous for themselves. They want to be recognized, admired, and emulated by others. They want to be part of the spotlight, to be known, to be celebrated. But what is fame? Is it truly desirable? Or is it a hollow shell of self-importance? To answer this, let us consider a few things.
Fame is often associated with achievement. An actor, an artist, or a scientist may strive to become famous for their talents. But is it truly a desirable end? Can a person truly say that being famous is a worthy goal? I think not.
Firstly, fame can be fleeting. One day, a person may be a household name. The next day, they may be forgotten. A celebrity's popularity can be as ephemeral as a sunset. And once a person is forgotten, they are gone. For all their fame and fortune, they have not left anything behind.

Secondly, fame is a curse in itself. It brings with it a host of problems. A person who is famous is often shunned and despised by the common man. They are seen as arrogant, selfish, and <END>

For how can it happen, but that the peace of all the world must come to an end, when all men shall be united, and in harmony with one another?

<BEGIN> On the passage of time
Time itself, in all the parts of it, is a kind of eternal passage; and to continue always in motion, is that which it doth essentially require; and of itself, doth require that, which it cannot omit: i.e. to pass away, and to move ever on, that it may continue eternal. The first thing, that doth require that it should pass away, is itself: for that is that, which doth continually change and alter; and so it requires it self to change. For what doth the change and alteration of things, consist of, but this? That they must pass away; and be continually changed? And as for that, which they are, or have been, this is also required: That that is, which they are or have been, should be passed away; and that, which they are not, should come. For a thing, that is or is not, is not. And therefore, that which is not, should come; and that which is, should be passed away. But if this be true, that it is not, and yet that it be: How can it be, that that which is not, should not come? The reason of all things, that are not, <END>

But if the multitude be ungodly and disobedient, how can the multitude be godly? And if the multitude be full of vice and disorder, how can the multitude be full of grace? For if it be so, the multitude, being full of grace, can give the true sense of the thing, but the multitude being full of grace, they cannot understand grace; and if the multitude cannot understand grace, then is it impossible for any other multitude to do justice. For that is not a multitude that doth justice, which doth not understand grace. For grace is not to give judgment, but to give grace: and that which is done in justice <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain is a common problem that can be solved, even with limited knowledge, and also a very common problem. Everyone suffers from it at some point, but those who have had their lives in their hands and had the opportunity of being cured, have learned to endure their pains much better than those who have not been able. Therefore, let us have a regard to our own state; let us have regard to our own pain and suffering; and let us seek after the means to cure it. It is a pain that is most properly called pain of pain: a pain that is a pain to the mind; a pain of a spiritual pain that is most proper for those who have been accustomed to the exercise of their mind, as a surgeon or a scholar, and for those who have been accustomed to be busy with their hands, as a surgeon or a laborer. But, I say to thee, thou art a surgeon; thou must not therefore be satisfied with the common pain of the common pain; but seek after that which is called the pain of the mind.

As we have reason, so have we also experience, of the dangers of anger: which, in sooth, can scarce be tamed or conquered. But how shall we deal with anger? Or, in what manner shall we use it? Here is that which I shall observe and declare. In the beginning of it, do not suffer anger to be raised. If thou doest this, then only, shall anger not have power to take hold of thee. Next, in case thou art angry, and thy anger doth grow, and spread, and take root: do not suffer it to increase: for if it do, it shall not be soothed again, but will grow unto a bitter root; which shall, sooner or later, bring forth bitter fruit.

Firstly, consider, if thou art angry: what is the cause of it? If it be for the honour of thyself or another, consider this: whether it be truly worthy of thy honour, and of the honour of another. For this cause is often the occasion of anger: but if it be for the injury of another, consider whether it be a true injury: and if it be, what remedy canst thou take? or how canst thou remedy it <END>

OF all the parts of a man, that make up his whole body, some are more proper to reason of, and to be spoken of, than others. And thus we may conclude, that the understanding is the most excellent, and worthy of respect, that part of any man: For the understanding is that which doth judge and deliberate, and thereby it is that which doth determine and resolve. And by reason of its proper nature, it is the part that is most worthy of respect, and should be spoken of, and admired: For reason is that by which all things that are, are known and understood: For that which is true, is known and understood by reason: And therefore, for reason of the truth of its effects, it is that part of any man that should be the most respected, and admired of all.

Now let this be understood, that in the understanding of any man, there are certain things, that are worthy of respect, and should be spoken of, and admired; that is, such things as are common to all men; and such things as are true, and certain: And thus, the understanding being the fountain, from which all knowledge, and reason <END>

In this particular of man's behavior, and the relations and mutualities of those that are amongst him, there doth lie a great diversity amongst men; and many causes do produce this diversity. The first of all, is, the nature of man himself: which, by some, is taken to be a creature most excellent, and well-ordered: by others, a creature most base, and most ill-ordered: and some, also, a creature most reasonable, and most well-ordered; and most of them, it must be confessed, that have in their natures, both good and evil principles. These, then, two things, we must first consider, and then only, will we see the true causes of the diversity amongst men.

We must consider, first, the nature of man, and in that nature, the two contrary principles, of good and evil, or the virtues and the vices. These two principles, and these two kinds, of things, are the only things, that do ever properly, and properly well, govern, and direct, any action whatsoever; and all the actions of man, do therefore, in their proper and proper, <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless, according to the ancient Stoics
According to ancient Stoic philosophy, the purpose of life is not to achieve fame, power, or wealth. Instead, the goal is to cultivate a deep sense of inner strength, wisdom, and inner peace. As Epictetus, a prominent Stoic philosopher, said:
"It is impossible for any man to be both happy and averse to what he ought to do, for as long as that aversion lasts, there is either an absence of all care, or an excess of care for things that are not capable of being done. Let no man ever think that his happiness can be without an end of action." (Discourses, I, 11) — [1]

This Stoic emphasis on inner strength, wisdom, and inner peace is a central theme in many of their writings. For example, Marcus Aurelius, a Stoic emperor, wrote in his famous book, Meditations:
"All that a man doeth in this world, either doth nothing, or it doth something either truly, or falsely; as, by doing the good, or evil; as by speaking, doing, or suffering; or that which is, not, or which doth exist; or that which doth not exist; or <END>

But is it not rather the sense that the universe is not entirely devoid of peace... But that also, what gives peace in the midst of tumult?... Is it not that which gives peace that also gives order? And so it must be. And this is that which gives peace."

From "On the Origin and Nature of the World, or the Universe" by Aniela Cronin, a Polish mystic who lived in the 18th century.

The above passage is a beautiful meditation on the nature of peace in the face of conflict and turmoil. Aniela Cronin, a Polish mystic who lived in the 18th century, reflects on the nature of peace and how it is connected to order and reason. She suggests that the source of peace is not a thing, but rather a state of mind, one that is characterized by a sense of order and reason. And she further suggests that this state of mind is the one that gives peace, and that it is also the one that gives order. It is a profoundly spiritual and introspective meditation, <END>

Of the passage of time.
How hath time itself been made use of! What is that which, when made use of, doth outlive all other things! What is that which, after being used once, cannot be used again, but must be made anew every day, and for every day? Time, time, time! Thou art the life of all things! Thou art the measure of all things!

Of the measure of time.
In respect of all things which are either spiritual or temporal, and whatsoever they be, whether they be spiritual, or whether they be temporal, or whether they be both, all things, are contained within the compass of time. Time, that which is without end, and without measure, is the proper and natural measure, and proportion, and number, of all things. It is that which, when things are divided, the parts of them are cut by time, and made up into a proportion; which doth make the true proportion of things.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence, or the silence of virtue; in Greek philosophy called eironeia, which properly is called the silent virtue.
For there is a silence that is not of man; the silent virtue; but that which is of man, and his, in his silence. For a man, in his silence, is a silent virtue; but not a virtue, in his silence; that is to say, if his silence be not a virtue; but in his virtue, his silence is. And as for those that do speak, they speak, in their virtue, but not in their silence. For that which they speak, is their virtue, but that which they hold in their silent hearts, is not. And of this, the very words themselves do tell us: Silence, as we said, is a virtue: for she is a virtue, as a woman; for that is the proper part of a woman, to be gentle, modest, and silent.
And again, a man may be a man, and not be virtuous; as a horse, and not be a horse. And the reason of it, is this: Virtue is one of those things, which must be made of matter: and so is silence. For the one is a man, and the <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain
We must, with regard to pain, neither seek for itself nor shun it, nor regard it as either a pleasure or a pain, but rather look upon it as a kind of suffering that doth arise from the natural constitution of the body: and if thou shalt endeavour to bear it with patience and equanimity, thou shalt be able to bear it well, for the suffering of it doth not lie in the pain itself, but in the passion of the mind; and the passion of the mind is that which makes the pain of the body so painful. When we see a man who doth bear pain well, we must not be put out of patience by his patience, for his patience is a kind of endurance, wherein he doth make himself worthy of God's grace and mercy; and it is a matter of the greatest difficulty and great labour for any man to bear pain well, for the body is naturally disposed to feel pain, and pain is a natural evil, and it is a matter of great difficulty and labour for any man to bear it without pain, and yet, if we consider the matter well, we must not think that it is unreasonable that any man should bear pain well, for as a matter of fact, we see many men bear <END>

Let not a man's mind be troubled with angry thoughts and rancorous passions; but, on the contrary, let him seek to put them off and away. And to those who do speak in a loud and clamorous manner, and do disturb others, let them know that it is not a matter of indifference, that they speak in such a manner. For it is a thing of the greatest weight and importance, that they do disturb others, by the disturbance of their minds; and they must expect, that those who are disturbed and vexed by it, shall seek a remedy, as the case may be, and as is meet; as to take a gentle reproof, and a kind admonition, and so forth.

by John Milton.

This question, of what is the nature of the universe and all things within it, doth generally belong unto Philosophers.  Yet,  even of them, there is a certain order, whereby their several opinions and ways of thinking, about those things, are distributed among them.

The same (by which I, John,  may say) the question of the nature of the universe, doth belong unto Philosophers.

They are the same, in whom that question is discussed and discussed, and are, also, of one sort; because they are all Philosophers.

The same thing, whereby all the Philosophers are Philosophers, doth belong unto the rest.

And therefore,  all these are of the same kind, and are called Philosophers,  and all the rest, as well.  But how are they, of the same kind?  By what means are they of that kind?  This is a question, that is of great difficulty and hardiness of mind.

What is the nature of the universe?  That, that is called the true universe; that, that is called heaven and earth, that is the universe.

<BEGIN> How to face death

Death is inevitable and inexorable. In his natural and common course, death is an indispensable part of nature, as necessary as birth, as certain as the day and the year, as common as the air and water that we breathe. We must not suppose that there are many men who do not at last meet with death; for death is as universal as human generation. It is impossible for man to live for ever; because it is impossible for a man to be boundless and infinite in his life. The course of human life is naturally limited. It is possible for one man to live for many years. It is not possible for one man to live for ever. In the life of the world, it is the same thing. It is possible for many men to live for many years. It is not possible for many men to live for ever. Death is a common, natural, and ordinary part of the life of the world. It is as common as the light and darkness. It is as necessary as the heat and cold. It is as natural as the day and the year.

It is not right to make death a matter of indifference and a thing that is not to be feared. We are not only bound to fear death, but we must fear death. <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader, whether in private or public affairs, is to provide and distribute in a manner suitable to the occasions and ends of things, the things necessary to the public or to himself for the good of those, of whom he is the leader, and for the preservation of his own liberty and quiet. For every one who would take care, that he should not be the leader, or principal leader, of any, that were either vicious or impious, that they might not do any thing that he should not do, must provide for his own safety. And it is necessary that he should be so, both by reason, and by law, that every man may see, and know, that it is the duty and obligation, of those who are leaders, to be careful for their own safety, as well as for the good of those, of whom they are the leaders. And in order to this, and to the full execution of that duty, it must be that every man, who is a leader, and a public leader, must be in a manner, and properly, bound.

<BEGIN> On logic and reason.  In the year 1550, a man of a good family, who was a very zealous and devout man, was, by the Lord, sent upon a particular mission.  This man had never before handled the sword, and yet, by God's grace, he did execute his mission with great honour and success.  By reason of his honourable conduct, his family did much honour to him.  And in time, when his family was fallen from their good estate and honour, he was, in the end of his days, restored to them.  Now, what cause was this?  That the same man, who had never before handled the sword, had in the end of his days recovered his family.  The cause was this, that this man was a very devout man; that is, that he had never departed from God.  The Lord was his ally, his protector and defender.  And God was the same Lord, who had sent this man upon the mission, that is, who had been his ally, his protector and defender, whilst he was upon the mission, as I have said before.

As the other I may now speak of: — that if a man may be called a good man, he must be of such a mind. For as I say, that a good man must be of a good mind: so that the good mind is of a good man. For it is of that man, and of that only, that the good mind is, for if he were of that mind, he would be a good man indeed; and if he were of that mind, he would be a good man indeed, for such a mind is a good mind indeed; and such a mind, being of a good man, is a good mind indeed.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless, and why the most popular artist of all time, Elvis Presley, was a good man
Why do people care so much about things that aren't really important? Why do we value fame and fortune and celebrity status so highly?
The answer is simple. People are easily swayed and influenced, and they have an innate desire for status and power. They want to be part of the "in crowd," and they want to be admired and respected. But the problem is that this desire for status and power is based on superficial qualities like fame and celebrity. When the real substance of human existence is ignored, it is easy to become distracted from what is really important.
But what about the famous and wealthy? Do they truly appreciate the finer things in life, or are they just as shallow as the rest of us?
The famous and wealthy, such as Elvis Presley, were generally good men. They may have had some flaws, but they were not as shallow as they often appear to be. They were intelligent, kind, and compassionate. They genuinely cared about the welfare of others.
Elvis Presley, the most popular artist of all time, was a good man. He was a kind, gentle soul. He was a true gentleman, always treating others with respect and <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace, he began to ponder over his former ways and deeds. As a man who is bound up in his own thoughts and desires, and is entirely devoted to the things of his own understanding, and, as it were, confined in his own thoughts and cares; he is not in a good condition to help another to find peace. But if the soul of the man that is troubled be opened to the grace of the divine, and he is made willing and obedient to the divine commandments, and he is made to understand the things of the soul, he begins to be in a good condition to help another. And thus, if a man be able, he will be able to help another man also to find peace, that is, to find a real peace, a true and real peace, not a nominal and false peace. A real peace is peace, that is a true and real peace, that is not disturbed by any troubles or disturbances; a peace, that is a real and true peace, which is the peace of the soul, and which is the peace of the kingdom of God. A nominal peace, and a false peace, is that peace, which is the peace of the world, that is, the peace of the world, and the peace of the flesh <END>

<BEGIN> On the passage of time. I did think, that that was the chief part of the art of life, that the more men shall take care and concern themselves about, the more that the very life itself shall be diminished and reduced. To use that which is, to have as little as may be, to reduce them to that, and to keep them to their natural, natural and proper limits and bounds. To take the greatest pleasure and comfort and contentment that can be gotten out of anything that is. The more that we make use of the present moment, the less is the time of that present moment. Therefore, when that is once lost, what is to be done? By this time it will be too late, and that will not be amended. And it is just the same with anything else, if we once lose the present time, there is no remedy. But that we may not lose the present time, let us be always of that intention, and let our whole conduct be, to use the present time. And as we will not live long, and as it is but a very little while since we did begin to live, let us not make too long or too long a stay in the world, but as soon as is convenient let us away to that which is better. <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is the most necessary virtue, because all those that do speak, either do nothing, or do some of the things, which, though they be nothing of themselves, have a very great consequence, and effect. The cause of this is, that as soon as a man speaks, he doth necessarily leave off the things, which are his proper occupation and business. So that one of the things, which a man ought to do, is that for the space of his speech, he should cease to do other things, that he doth. But this cannot be done, if a man do speak much, because a man can do no other thing, till he have finished his speaking. And the cause why this is, is, that the act of speaking, is a single act. But it is a single act of the voice, not of the whole man. For the voice is but a part of the man, and only the voice can speak; but the heart, and the understanding, and the rest of the man can think, and be occupied, and do other things.

That man, however, as a mere mortal, had that same temper, which many of those who take part in great deeds, have. But that man, by his actions, showed a more gentle and temperate nature. It is not by accident, but by a divine providence, that a man of noble birth, and of a gentle and temperate nature, should be the one to take the field. For they who are of a gentle and temperate nature, are the only ones, who can be at peace, and who can govern their own passions. And they who are of a noble birth, are those only, who are fit for a noble and good action; for it is not those who are of a lower condition, or who are not of a good constitution, that are fit for such things; but those only who are of a noble and good birth, are such.

<BEGIN> How to face death and to overcome it.
Death is a natural part of human life. The death of one man or woman is the natural beginning of the birth of another. Death is the end of all the pains and troubles and troubles of this life. It is the beginning of a new life; of a new body; of a new soul; and of a new bliss. The first part of man, which is the soul or spirit, which is immortal, and incorruptible, is not subject to death, but remains, as long as the universe, which is the body of all that exists. It is necessary then, if we wish to be happy, to regard death not as something hateful and loathsome, but as a great good. And we shall be happy, if we can endure it patiently and willingly, and if we can carry our selves with the ease and composure, and firmness, and fortitude of a good soldier. And, to carry ourselves with ease and composure, and firmness, and fortitude, in the face of death, is not only possible, but easy: it is not difficult. For it is not necessary that thou shouldst be afraid of death, in order to be able to carry thyself in the face of death. <END>

Pain and discomfort are often associated with suffering. However, for some, they may be a natural part of life. In order to endure pain and discomfort with equanimity, one should consider the following.

A painless world, or at least a world less painful than ours, may exist in some other form or condition. Whether in a future life or in a future world, this is the chief thing to look after, to secure the happiness of the soul. Let us look upon a world, or a universe, so constituted as to produce as much happiness, peace, and quietness as can be imagined; and let us consider, how these things can be brought about.

To do this, we must first of all set our hearts right. We must, in all our ways, do what is good and just. We must also use all due diligence to prevent the occurrence of evil. Let us take care to live honestly and sincerely. Let us avoid all falsehood, and all hypocrisy. Let us be sincere in all our dealings and words.

Of the shortness of life; or, of the shortness of man's continuance in the world.

Now there is a general opinion amongst the vulgar, that man's continuance in the world doth not exceed but one day; or at most two, and three at most. But this opinion of ours, is quite contrary. For truly we know, that man's continuance in this world doth extend to an hundred years; nay, and even a hundred years more; as is evident by the experience of those men, who have lived to a hundred, and even to one hundred and fifty years. Now let us look, that the life of man, which is so short, and fleeting, may yet be of some use.

And, as such, he is a law unto himself, and unto all men: for the same reason, that the natural law is unto man. But the natural law, is a mere imitation, or representation. of a higher, and divine law. Which is not only a law unto man, but unto all rational creatures, which is, the law of reason, which is a part of God’s law. And so, from this divine law, and natural law, is derived the moral law, or common law. And so, by the moral law, and common law, men are governed, in their daily conduct. And it is from this, that the commonwealth of the world is governed.
That man therefore, that is truly religious and just, and governed by the moral law, and common law, is the same, that is governed by the divine law, and the law of God. And that, he that is governed by the divine law, and the law of God, is truly religious and just.

The Stoics said that death is nothing else but a change: that it is the end of man: and that there is nothing that is peculiarly the property of the soul; but that all things are subject to decay.

Now, that reason, or the use of reason, doth consist in the observation and consideration of those particulars, which are called the particular causes and circumstances, and in the use of their reciprocal relations, which do conduce to one and the same end; this, I say, is plain and evident to the understanding; and if it be not, then that the understanding doth seem to be a blind, or an insensible organ, and therefore void of reason.
The reason, which I have used, to shew how reason and understanding do proceed from a natural and ordinary constitution of man, as a rational animal, is, to consider and examine, whether it be possible for a man, without any special constitution of his organs, or <END>

The moral faculty which is proper to our rational soul is the ground of our virtuous actions and the object of our virtuous actions is the proper operation of that moral faculty.
To find out the particular act or action which is of itself and proper to every thing, and according to the proper constitution and operation of that thing, is an act of understanding. And therefore the knowledge and discovery of that proper operation of things, and the act or action which is of itself proper, are things of great importance and great use in the understanding. But to know what things are properly or suitably disposed, or adapted, to that proper or natural action, that is to say, to know what things are proper to certain actions or operations, that is, the use, and application, of that particular action or operation, and that also which are not properly or suitably disposed, or adapted, to that action or operation, and to know, which things, being properly disposed or adapted, they cannot do the action or operation which is proper to that thing, and to know which things being not properly disposed or adapted, they cannot be done, that <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless, according to a philosophy professor.
A philosophy professor recently shared her insights on the nature of fame. She discussed how it can lead to a loss of authenticity and a disconnection from one's true nature. The professor said that true fulfillment comes from living a meaningful life, and that fame is ultimately empty and unsatisfying. She emphasized the importance of living a life that is grounded in reason and virtue, rather than seeking fame and popularity. The professor concluded that true fulfillment comes not from external validation, but from a deep understanding of oneself and the world around us. She encouraged her audience to focus on their inner lives, and to cultivate virtues and reason. She emphasized that true happiness is found in the cultivation of the virtues and the pursuit of wisdom. She also emphasized that one should not be swayed by the opinions of others, but should instead trust in one's own judgment and reason. The professor encouraged her audience to live a life of simplicity and humility. The professor said that true happiness can only be achieved through the cultivation of the virtues and the pursuit of wisdom. She also said that true happiness comes not from wealth, status, or fame, but from living a life that is in accordance with nature and the order of the universe. In summary, the philosophy professor discussed the <END>

Peccadilloes are many; yet of them, peaceable persons are very few.
This is no small matter, that for many years together, many men had found peaceable persons amongst their neighbors.
Happily for men, they are many in the world, whose peaceable and holy life is the only and proper way.
The common saying, that all men will be honest and just in time, is as true as the saying is, that a woman can have no child, but out of her own body.
And thou, my child, that is the truest saying.
Thou must be patient, for thy sins are many, but God is not angry with thee, and therefore thou must not be afraid.
Thy sins are many, but God is not angry with thee, for he is a God of mercy.
But thou must be a holy person, as God is holy.
To be a holy person, is the only true and proper way to live.
For all worldly men and women, have all their actions and practices, so ordered, that they may be the best possible instruments, for some earthly and temporal thing.

Which common hand hath written that very thing which is already passed, and which is already dead: and that they, who write the laws and statutes; are also dead. But what is this common hand that writeth? The reason of which, I must now speak. As I was saying, the common hand, which doth write and pass all that which is written, is the hand of God.

The same that that did make the world, did also make this common hand of writing and passing: and therefore can not but be the very same God that made the world. And in what manner is the common hand of writing and passing the same as that which made the world? Because all that is written in the books of God's law, is that which was done by the hands of angels, that is to say, of angels, who were also, as to their nature, not different from those angels that are not angels.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is a great virtue. Silence is not the absence of words, but the proper use of those which are spoken. It is a temperate use of speech, and the proper restraint of it. It is the true sign of wisdom and understanding, that those, who are truly wise, are not only able to speak, but also able to be silent. For in speaking, there is much the matter of ignorance and error. But when they speak not, they have much the better of it; for in the silence of themselves, they are able to discern truth, and to discern false-hood. In the silence of themselves, they are able to see clearly, and to perceive all things. They have also the better power of commanding and governing. The whole world is subject to the king and sovereign power; but as to the power of governing themselves and their own lives, it is a power belonging only to themselves; and it is the power that is most properly and naturally subject to the will of God; and is a power which God has committed unto all men, for that which they shall use their own proper power. To govern and rule themselves; is truly a rule and a law of nature. That which is best is best for all things: and what is best, <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain: The Stoics on suffering and affliction
The Stoics held that the power to endure pain or suffering was a great and important virtue. For the Stoic, pain or suffering is not a bad or evil thing in itself. On the contrary, it is an indispensable and necessary part of the good life, for pain is a necessary condition of happiness and perfection. The Stoic is not a person who is averse to pain and suffering, but is willing to endure it and even to embrace it, for he knows that it is not a part of the good life that is to be avoided, but one of the things which are necessary and proper for the good life. This is clearly seen in the history of Socrates, who endured the death of Socrates, and yet was perfectly at ease with himself. But even in cases of other kinds, the Stoic is perfectly easy with himself, for he has learned to endure every thing which may happen to him.
But, perhaps, you may say, that pain is not necessary or proper to the good life. The Stoic will answer that pain is necessary or proper to the good life, if that is what is proper to that life. Pain and suffering are parts of the natural constitution of the body, which is <END>

A nation of Ethiopia.

And yet are we to suppose, that this Herod that is so much spoken of, is that Herod that is mentioned in the other Epistles of the Apostles: For in the third Epistle of John, is written thus: “Where the fornicator and the drunkard, and all manner of evil doers, there, also, will be such a thing that they will be ashamed to enter into the <END>

We must consider what kind of temper we have; we must look into our own nature, and what it is that doth stir us up to anger, or any other passion. For when we have considered that, then only can we learn to deal with it properly.
How then are we to deal with anger? If anger were but a common passion, so that all men should be angry and all women also, I should not be afraid of anger, so as that my anger might be common and free. But that is not the case. For, as men say, there are not all alike; some are more of a certain kind than others. And among the men of the world, there are some that are angry with a good spirit, and some that are angry with an evil spirit; some that are angry, and some that are not angry. And therefore we must take heed, that we do not deal with any that are angry, in that manner that we should do with an angry one in the first place.

<BEGIN> How to face death. How to prepare yourself to meet God. And to bear thyself in the world, as thou wouldst if thou couldst live evermore. How to end thy life, with honour and glory.

The book that hath been set forth now, as a common saying is, is the best, that ever was, for those that would know the true way unto eternal life, and to live well in this world.

He that would know the true way, unto eternal life, must first learn to die, for unless he doth, he is not able to live well, for death is the beginning of life.

Therefore to die well is to begin well.

To die well, is to begin well, and to end well, as thou hast begun.

Therefore if any man begin to die, he must not only think, how he shall end his life, but also, how he shall begin and end it, with honour and glory.

A true man, is he that doth live in himself, and doth not live in others, and that is that only that is worthy to live.

The behaviour of a man, which doth well and truly deserve praise, is that of him who is mindful of God; and who doth continually think of him, and doth carry that thought and consideration in his heart, even to the death; and who doth believe and accept the true faith. And of the same, the behaviour of the man, and the conduct of his actions, is that, which, when he hath committed a fault, doth immediately seek to make amends for it, either to one or more of those, of whom it is not merely a fault, but a sin, and a great and heinous sin; or to the whole world, or to some part thereof.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless in modern times
Fame is fleeting, superficial, and ephemeral. The more famous one becomes, the more ephemeral and superficial one’s life becomes.
Fame, however, can be both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it provides an opportunity to share one’s message and inspire others. On the other hand, it can also bring out the worst in people and lead them to lose their dignity.
Fame can also lead to a kind of superficiality, where people prioritize appearances over substance. A famous person may have millions of followers and admirers, but if he or she lacks substance, integrity, and character, then fame is merely a hollow shell. In this case, fame is more a curse than a blessing.
Another aspect of fame is its emptiness and shallowness. A famous person may be surrounded by admirers, but if they are superficial, then fame is merely an empty shell. This emptiness can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
Fame can also bring out the worst in people, particularly in their behavior towards others. Some may resort to arrogance and condescension, while others may resort to cruelty and malice. Fame can also bring out the worst in people’s desires, particularly in their lust for power <END>

There is one thing only which I do think is most useful and profitable: To be at peace and contented. For of that only, either is all good, or can nothing be done that is truly good and goodly.

To be at peace is the same as to live and to flourish. For either those things which we do are in themselves good and commendable, and that is the true meaning of happiness and happiness to be found; or those things which we do are evil and unprofitable: and then that is not true happiness, but some other kind of thing; as inordinate desire, or some such other evil. For then must the end of those things which we do be evil; and that is not to be done.

Therefore is it true, that it is a great happiness that a man hath of a well-disposed and well-ordered life, and a faithful and true devotion unto God. For of that we are sure, that all things whatsoever <END>

<BEGIN> On the passage of time, what do we really know?
Our memories of things past are often obscure and confused, and may easily be distorted or altered. The events, that are recorded in history, may be either false or partly false. The causes and occasions of things, of which we have knowledge, may be either mistaken or obscure. The very fact itself, of which we have knowledge, may be doubtful or questionable.

This passage is from David Hume, in his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, section 13. He is arguing that our knowledge of the world and our understanding of events are always incomplete and imperfect. This is a central theme in Hume's philosophy: that our understanding is limited by our cognitive faculties and our experience, and that we can never be certain of anything. This passage is a good example of Hume's skepticism and his emphasis on the provisional nature of human knowledge. It also shows his typical style, which is formal and formalistic, with a focus on the logical and rational analysis of philosophical problems. Overall, this passage is a good example of Hume's contribution to the philosophy of science and the philosophy of knowledge. <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence. If it were true that the mind was not always active, but only a part of it was, then it must be, that a part of it was sometimes silent. The silence of a part of the mind is no other than the slumber of one part of the body. In such cases, the body, though it doth slumber, is still the same; the soul is still the same. It doth not change its substance, its operation, its properties. But what is this, that doth change, that doth alter and transform its operation, and its properties, which is the nature of the mind, and of that which doth actuate and direct it? In like manner, as when the body is slumbering, yet still it is the same body that is, which is the same body that it was, it is so with the mind: that doth not change, and alter, which doth operate, and direct. What doth it change, which doth change its properties, its operation, and its substances, if not that part which doth operate, and direct? (Thomson, p. 17.) The mind doth not change, if it be silent.

At first, then, he thought that, as he was in a body which would soon die, and as it was his duty, to give his soul up to God, who had given her unto him, and whose she she was; so he ought not to be afraid, or unwilling to go into her, as he would a little further, to the place where it is decreed, that the spirits of those men should go; but to make haste, and to get away with all speed, as he could. For this life is very short, in the age of Antipater. Hereof it is evident, that it is necessary for the life of every man, in the same age, and at the same time, that he should take heed of his own. The things that are done in that age, which are done by some one man, as an instrument unto others; the things which are done by some one man, which are done unto others, are those things, of which they ought to take heed.

Yet of the world, I speak thus much, that it is made of a true and material substance, and that this true and material substance doth contain it selfe: that the true and material substance, of which it is, doth contain within itself the matter of all things; that the matter of all things, is contained in the matter of all things; that it doth contain, and preserve all things in it selfe.
This he doth not say, that the true and material substance, which is the matter of all things, doth itself contain within it selfe all things, but that it doth contain and preserve all things in it selfe, in respect of its own selfe.

To live, to love, and to die. But that to live a long time is not necessary, as many that lived a hundred and forty years, and more, have not died of old age, but of suddenness, or by violence. But to die, as it is natural, to do as it shall please God. A true Christian may die peaceably, as a true and faithful servant of God, as such they are indeed, and must be.

From a true and faithful Christian, it is reasonable to expect, that his mind shall be satisfied and contented. The Christian religion, as it was instituted by Christ, and delivered by the Apostles, is nothing else, but the doctrine of the one true God, and the one only Savior, Jesus Christ. From hence, as the Christian religion is a true religion, it must follow, as a consequence, that he that lives a life according to the laws of God, and in the right order of his soul and body, must not only die well, but must die in peace. But he, that doth not live a life according to God’s laws, must necessarily die in confusion and discomfiture.

He must, in the first place, consider of the motions, and exercises proper unto the understanding, and will, and affections, and passions, and motions of the body.

That which is reasonable and natural, and that which is foolish, and unreasonable, and that which is unjust, and unreasonable, and that which is just, are so many different things, that we must have an exact and particular understanding of one, before we can judge of the other.

And truly, who ever can say, that he knows and understands what is to be done, whoever he be? for all men are of such a condition, that they must seek and examine, whether anything which they do, or omit, is according to the will of God; for if they should do any thing which is contrary unto it, they should be guilty, and incur his wrath: but if they should omit the things, which God would have done, and do those things, which he would have omitted, they should be guilty, and incur his wrath: therefore, a true and good knowledge, of that which is to be done, is necessary, in order to our salvation and deliverance.

For the silence, and the noise, are not both equally, but rather, in proportion to their different kinds and natures, but in respect of a common measure of measure, are in proportion.

The thing now that is to be observed is, that a stillness is not the same with a silence. For a silence is a silence of words; but a stillness is a silence of things.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain and toil and hard work is one of the greatest excellences of human nature; for as there is much pain, so is there more happiness. For to every kind of pleasure, there corresponds a kind of pain. And therefore it is that the pleasures of the world, and the delights of the body, are so often changed into pains: and this is true also of the pains and miseries of the world.
Every man has an opinion or belief, either in matters of faith or matter of opinion, either among men, or with himself; and sometimes, or in some way, they are not easy to be changed: for it is not in human power to make them so.
In that case, when one or more of the tenets or doctrines of religion or of philosophy are contrary to one another, and not to be reconciled; then to have the best and greatest ease, one or other of those doctrines must be abandoned; and this, according to some, must be done by way of doubt, and hesitation; and according to the other, by way of persuasion.

All angry and wrathful, and full of indignation and ire, let thyself not be: let it not take hold of thee, neither in thy heart, nor in thy actions.

Beware not of evil, nor of the wrathful; but rather of avarice, of vanity, of pride, and of the passions.

Be thou mindful that as long as thou livest, thou art a stranger and a wanderer, and as long as thou livest, thou art in the world, and in this world; and so shalt thou not cease from living, and from the world, and from this world.

He that is angry, and yet doth not seek to be reconciled with those against whom he is angry: he that doth not seek to be reconciled with any, but doth seek only himself: that is, that he may be in the world, and in the flesh: this is the true wickedness, which the law abhors.

Death, or the transmigration, is not that which the wise and prudent men speak of.

But what it is to die, and how one shall be happy, or how one shall be miserable in death, is that which, as I have already said, we ought not to be afraid of: but rather to regard and consider, how one may in death be at peace, and in a good disposition: and what is most certain, that is, the death of the body is not that of the soul, and is only that of the body: and that the soul shall live, or shall live on, and be preserved, is that which, according to the best grounds and reasons of nature, is most true, and reasonable: and what, therefore, is the true and proper way to die, and how one may be at peace and happy in death, that is, to die by one's own fault, or by accident, and to die with a good conscience, and with a calm and peaceful heart, <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is to see the problem clearly and take action. But often a leader may not see the problem clearly or may not know how to take the necessary action.
Sometimes, the problem is not a problem at all, but rather a misconception or a misunderstanding. And sometimes, a problem is not a problem at all, but rather a challenge that needs to be taken up in order to achieve something greater. Leadership is about finding and solving problems, and it requires a lot of work and effort to do so. As a leader, one must be able to analyze situations, make sound judgments, and make informed decisions. And most importantly, a leader must be able to take action and implement their decisions. So, whether it is a leader of an organization or a leader of a community, they must have the skills and abilities to see the problem, diagnose the problem, and take action to solve it.
And what is a problem, you may ask? A problem is any situation, situation, circumstance, event, or situation that needs to be dealt with and resolved. A problem is something that can hinder or hinder one's ability to achieve one's goal. It can also be a challenge, a test of one's character. And a problem can also be an opportunity, a chance to do <END>

<BEGIN> On logic and reason, or the art of reasoning; it is sufficient to refer to the writings of Aristotle; and as he also used to say, “that a thing is either true, or false, or neither; and that one may truly or falsely judge of it, according to the nature of its properties; and that this kind of truth or falsehood can never be in the power of any man, either truly to discern it, or falsely to judge it.” That which is either true or false, can be nothing else than this or that, or what it is. But it can never be anything else but true, or false. (p. 9–10)

Note that this passage is not from an individual philosopher, but is attributed to Aristotle. This is because, in the 16th and 17th centuries, Aristotle was considered to be an authority and a repository of knowledge, and many of his writings had been translated and published in various editions.

Now, I have no objection to it; because, if it is true, then it is true; and if it is false, then it is false: and so all things either true or false. And this is that truth which I speak of. (p. 12–13)

It is in vain to be angry with a man, for a thing, which was not done at the same time. For it is the part of the wise and prudent man, to be angry at the same time, for that which is done, and which doth hurt him.

This work is a collection of philosophical thoughts on various subjects, and is not a systematic or methodical work, but is rather a series of discourses and reflections, not very systematic, and therefore not very well arranged. As it was written by a man, who was not very learned in philosophy, nor very well skilled in the art of speaking, his discourse is not very smooth and agreeable. But as it is a work of a man who did strive to be worthy of the name of a philosopher, and of the knowledge and understanding that belonged to such a man, it is not less deserving of attention, and consideration, than the works of those who were more learned and more skilled in the art of speaking. And as this work is a very recent writing, it may be that some persons will be disposed to esteem it the more for that, but others will perhaps regard it rather with the eye of a philosopher, and the consideration of a man who hath truly endeavoured to attain to true philosophy; for true philosophy is that only, which is according to the nature of things, and <END>

Sometimes, to be silent, is profitable and necessary. The ancient Greeks, were in the habit of praising silence as a virtue. They used the phrase, " silen[tium] est quod est adaequatum ad actionem" (silence is that which is agreeable to the action). For they considered that, as the eye must be closed, in order to preserve the sight; and the ear must be closed, in order to preserve the hearing, so also the mouth must be closed, in order to preserve the discourse. And they did not speak, as a rule, to children, as they would soon learn to speak and write themselves. And they did not speak to strangers, if it were possible, but kept themselves to themselves; that they might not disturb the rest of others, and that they might enjoy their own. For they did not desire, as any man ought to do, that which is to the common benefit and utility of all men, and which doth conduce to the glory of God.

Endurance of pain is one of the most important and excellent virtues, because it is necessary in all parts of life, and the only way of living, in so much that without it we cannot live at all. To bear patiently and gladly whatsoever is laid upon us, that is, to endure, that is, not to resist, but to suffer, is a very excellent thing; for the first is the proper action of a man, and the latter, of a true servant of God. To do this, we must know the nature of our souls, and of our bodies, and how they are united together. To know this is the first and only thing that is necessary for the endurance of pain, and for the endurance of life. For this knowledge, the ancient philosophers and theologians did teach, and it is necessary for a good understanding, and for a holy and a virtuous life. And therefore let us first seek to know the nature of our souls and of our bodies, and to know how they are united together, and what is necessary for their good and for their health; and then let us seek to know what is necessary for the endurance of pain, and for the endurance of life.

But, as the matter stands, death is no more to be apprehended. It is a thing of the past, and nothing more. It is so long ago that it began, that now it can be nothing to thee, but as a thing that is already done and passed away. The reason of it is this, that it was but a few years ago, that thou didst first begin to live; and now that thou dost live, it is many years already that it is passed away. Thou canst not deny, that thou hast many years lived, since that thou didst first begin to live: but thou canst not deny that also thou art many years old. Now if thou hadst been many years old, thou hadst been many years dead. How then couldst thou be alive, when thou art also dead?

A great leader is always in action and in motion, always doing, never idle.

For if we should use some other way in one case, or in one occasion, that would be to deviate and to wander from the true path, and to follow the true path of reason.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless: A psychological analysis

Fame, by definition, is the recognition and admiration of others for one's accomplishments. It is often associated with a sense of prestige and status, and many people are driven by a desire to attain fame. However, research in psychology has shown that fame is ultimately a hollow and fleeting experience, devoid of intrinsic meaning and satisfaction.

From a psychological perspective, fame is a form of social validation that can activate the brain's reward system. When people receive praise and recognition, they experience a surge of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and motivation. This can create a feedback loop, where people continue to pursue fame in order to experience the feeling of reward and satisfaction. However, this feedback loop is ultimately unsatisfying and can lead to a sense of emptiness and disconnection.

Moreover, the pressure to maintain fame can be overwhelming, and the constant scrutiny and attention can be exhausting. People may feel pressure to maintain their image, and may compromise their values and principles in order to stay in the spotlight. This can lead to a sense of burnout and disillusionment, as they struggle to maintain the illusion of fame.

In addition, the fleeting nature of fame is a significant factor. People are constantly being replaced by new celebrities and public figures, and <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace of mind, the main part of happiness is that men should be in a quiet state, and at rest both of body and mind. For when the mind is not in any great perturbation, it is easy to manage such things as are subject to the mind; for all things subject to the mind are easily managed by a quiet mind.
The mind, being in quietness, is as a wall or a castle. It is not moved, either by the motions of the body, or by the concourses of the world. It is as a mountain, that is not moved by the tempests; and as a river that is not moved by the flood. For all the motions of the world, are subject to change, but the mind, that is quiet and still, is subject to no change.
For such is the nature of the mind, that it doth not change, save for a good or an evil opinion; for every good or evil opinion, doth change the state of the mind. But a good or an evil opinion, can never happen in the mind, that is not in a quiet state of mind, for in such a state the mind is free from all tumults, and passions; and is not subject to the motions of the body <END>

There are two kinds of silence. One is, that of a man, that he may think, and be, and do as he will, without the noise and tumult of men, or the distractions of the world: the other, that of a woman.

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is to guide his people, but the duty of the people is to obey the leader. The people, being many and different, may not all be equally good and wise. Some may be blind and foolish, and others may be ambitious and covetous. But the leader, who is wise and just, will endeavour to govern his people, and to prevent all evil. He will be the first to put the best interpretation on things. He will be the first to take notice of and to correct faults; but he will not be a tyrant or a despot. He will be the first to be gentle and kind: and he will set his people free from any fear or fearfulness.
This is the natural and common order of all good governments: that the leaders and rulers should be wise, and just, and kind: that they should rule over their subjects, not tyrantically or despotically: but as wise and kind parents and friends: and that the subjects should obey them, with a willing mind and heart: and that both sides, as far as the constitution of things, and the laws of nature, will concur, in order and concord.

<BEGIN> On logic and reason, how soon, how eagerly, how attentively doth one and the same man, and the same woman, and the same child, embrace and pursue after, and study the mysteries of them? Is it not plain and evident, that the nature of man is most bent and inclined to embrace and pursue after, and to study the mysteries of them?

And as for those who are ignorant of the true and proper use of their natural reason and understanding, they doth indeed seem to embrace and pursue after, and to study the mysteries of them, but as for their true nature and disposition, they are altogether different: and it is in vain to speak or write of the mysteries of them, till they have learned to use their natural reason and understanding, properly and according to nature.

And as for those who do use their natural reason and understanding, properly and according to nature, and in such a manner, that they can be called reasonable and rational, they doth indeed embrace and pursue after, and to study the mysteries of them. And their study and pursuit is indeed, according to nature and reason.

Firstly, of the things common to all the members of the common society, is such their common interest, and common security; for a common society is a society of men, united in such a way, that all that is of mutual use or benefit, is common to them: as for example, a common wall, and common defence.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless in life

Fame and wealth are things of the world that are empty and without meaning, as is clear to anyone of sound understanding who shall consider what these things are. For it is the true and only good, and it is this alone, that can ever make anyone happy and contented. But what is this true good? That it be not a sensual delight or pleasure, but rather a right and proper reason, or a true and true science.

When I first began to think and to consider, I must confess that I did not find myself so sensible, nor so well adapted, to be able to apprehend so many things of which the mind is capable, as the more I went on.

For, as the world, is in so great a hurry, to get to the place where they are to be carried; as they are, as they say, in so great a hurry, that they never think of anything but their speedy motion and their arrival, they do not look back or regard anything that is behind; and as they carry with them a certain forward motion, as they are going forward, so they are never satisfied with their journey; and the farther they go, the farther still they go; till they be gone.

And, in the end, <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace of mind, it is well to understand what causes it. If any man hath in his mind the notion, that there is one place that is more excellent than another, because one place is more excellent than another, let him understand, that the excellence of one place, compared to another, is not the true excellence. The true excellence of any place, is this, that in that place it is possible to live, and to be at ease. That is the true excellence, because that is the true happiness of the commonwealth. That is, that every man may be contented, and have a peaceful mind, and that every man may be able to live, and to be contented. This is the true happiness of a man; this is the happiness of the commonwealth. Let us not then be deceived by the vain glory of the world; let us not be seduced by the false notions of the wise. Let us then understand, that all that is good, is to live in peace. This is the only happiness of the world, which is to live in peace, and to be at ease. That is the true happiness, that is the true peace. That is the only peace, that is the only happiness. This is the way that is true <END>

<BEGIN> On the passage of time: an oration.
A man in the flower of his age, and of excellent beauty, as all the world did allow: But yet, how much more happy and contented was he, than all the rest; For to him, this present life, and that future, seemed as a happy and blessed thing. And yet, what were his hopes and expectations? They were that, at his death, and burial, he might be raised up again in heaven, and, among the blessed angels, be made happy and contented; But now, hereafter, what was to be the state of those, who were left behind? As they that have left their wives, children, and other families: Or as the very worms, and vermin, that did devour, and corrupt, their bodies, even after their death: And what did he? He that, with so much care and pains, and diligence, had lived before, and to live after, as his best and most profitable use, was that he did so, but in order, and provision, that he might, in his next state, be made happy, and contented, without any other cause or reason, than that which he did; But yet, this was not true.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence, or the practice of speaking, is often confusedly attributed by the Stoics to a certain type of foolishness or weakness, as though men were by nature of their very nature more inclined to be silent, and more apt to be foolishly silent, than otherwise.
The Stoics, on the other hand, do truly speak of silence. But their silence is not such as the Stoics imagine, and so it is to be distinguished from the silence of others. The Stoics, who do truly speak of silence, speak of silence as the proper and necessary use of the lips. The Stoics say, that every action which is proper and natural for any man, is by the very nature of man that action; and that nothing is natural unto man, that is not according to his nature. If therefore, the nature of man be to speak, then is that which is spoken of, a true and natural action. But what is it that is spoken of? The Stoics speak of nothing, but of that which is properly spoken.
In order to speak properly, one must speak from one's self; and from one's own self to be able to speak properly, one must be of a certain mind and disposition; and not to be of that kind of mind <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain
Pain, by its very nature, is an insidious and stealthy adversary. It comes upon us with little or no notice. It is as a thief, creeping in while we are sleeping, and stealing away before we are awake. It is a subtle and crafty wight, that doth not seek to do us harm, but only to do its part in its natural course, as it was made. And for what it doth, it doth but in a way that is consonant with its proper nature: it is not an enemy, but a member, and a part of the very constitution of our bodies.

We do not blame the fire for burning, or the wind for blowing; nor do we blame the rivers for flowing, or the seas for flowing; for these things are part of their nature, and are not contrary to it. Howbeit, in the case of pain, this is a point of great difficulty and perplexity. For whereas all other things do their parts in their own natural course, according to their proper natures, pain doth its part contrary to the very nature of the thing that is hurt; it doth not only do its part, but it doth also do it contrary to the common rule of nature <END>

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life. The first thing which I will say concerning the life of man, is, that it is short: and short is it, as I said, and yet doth contain a vast multitude of things, as it is very long in time.

It is a thing of great difficulty to answer of all the things which men use and say and do in their lives; for indeed many things, in time and number, exceed a thousand thousand, and it is impossible that any man should answer or understand any one thing; and so the life of man is short and long, short and long; and the very longness and shortness of life dependeth not on the body of man, but on the nature of man, which is a thing very difficult to be understood.

But of this hereafter.

Let me say unto thee, as I have said unto the rest, that it is a matter of great difficulty to know and to understand, and also of much difficulty, to speak and to answer, of all the things which men use and say and do; and that therefore the life of man, if it be truly understood, and properly understood, can be but very short; for it is very difficult, to understand any one thing of it; and indeed a thousand things, <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger.
There is nothing so easily handled, and so much to be admired in human affairs, as a man well-mannered, well-behaved, and well-tempered, though not necessarily happy. What is to be done with anger? what is to be done with pride, and with stubbornness, and with obstinacy, and with all other things that can anger or offend? What is to be done with those that have an angry disposition, with those that are proud and haughty, with those that are stubborn and obstinate, with those that are puffed up and inflated, and that are always full of conceit and self-satisfaction, and that are always full of envy and malice? How can those who are subject to any of those things be cured and healed? How can any of those things be cured and healed in themselves? For every such man must first be healed himself, before he can do any healing, or any good unto others. If any man be angry, he must first cool his angry passion, before he can do any good unto others, or even unto himself; for while anger doth hold him fast, he cannot do any good. And if any man be proud and haughty, and doth not temper his <END>

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe
Hegel's philosophical views about the nature of the universe, or world, are set forth in various passages, though he did not attempt to do this with the usual thoroughness, but rather only touched upon it at times. This is partly because it was not the chief point of his consideration, and partly because he did not think it necessary to give a particular view of it, in order to develop the proper part of his system; but as it happens, all the essential views that he did give, are very different from those of the common philosophers. The universe, he says, is an absolute, or one, reality, and it is only in that way that it can be called an absolute, and not a mere particular, or finite, or finite and particular one; as for example, that particular being which is called God. Now here he proceeds in a manner of reasoning, that is very different from the common, and is not to be found in any other philosopher, except perhaps in Plato. (1) For, he says, the one true and one real being, God, cannot be, at the same time, and as one being, and at the same time, as an infinite number of beings; otherwise it would be neither one, nor <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death and all the consequences of life? A thought-provoking meditation. — William Penn.

The things that make life worth living, are so common and frequent, that the mind of a wise man cannot help being so grieved when he finds he must leave them. For death is the termination of all our pleasures, all our affections, all our knowledge and understanding, all our actions and purposes, all our hope and desire. The question of our immortality is to be understood of that eternal and eternal life that is in Christ. It is a question of that eternal life of God’s love in us, and of that eternal life which we are to be born into. The only eternal life that is not eternal in this sense, is that which is in the flesh. It is the only eternal life that is not eternal in the sense of being eternal in itself, and not temporal in the sense of being temporal in the sense of being temporal in the sense of being temporal. It is the only eternal life that is not eternal in the sense of being temporal. It is the only eternal life that is eternal, but not eternal in itself. It is the only eternal life that is not eternal in the sense of being eternal in the sense of being eternal in the sense of being <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is to do what is right; and when he is wronged, as in that case he is, by some person, he is to be atone for; but to take any further vengeance upon that person, or to proceed any further in pursuit of justice, is not the duty of a leader.

This quote is from Francis Bacon (1561-1626). 

The full passage is:
"When a man is in his ordinary estate, he doth not desire to be any way wronged by any man; for a wrong doth not much affect a common man. But the same that doth wrong another, is in his ordinary estate a true and faithful member of the body politic; and doth, in the matter of his estate and trade, manage and conduct himself, as a good subject should.

But, when a man is wronged by a ruler; the case is different, and there doth properly belong a certain kind of satisfaction. The duty of a ruler is to do what is right; and when he is wronged, as in that case he is, by some person, he is to be atone for; but to take any further vengeance upon that person, or to proceed any further in pursuit of justice, is not the duty of <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
By definition, when people know and know well a particular person, then that person becomes a local celebrity; in other words, a local celebrity is a person well known in his own town or city. In other words, it is not about fame in general, but a specific fame which is tied to the place and to the town. Moreover, local celebrities do not live up to the standard of famous celebrities. For instance, when a local celebrity dies, people in his city and town do not mourn, as if their local celebrity died and there was a great sorrow in his city. If there was a local celebrity who was also famous outside his town and city, then people would mourn and they would be sorrowful.
On the other hand, when someone dies, the whole world mourns. In other words, when someone dies, their death is not known in a particular city or town, and a person in some other city or town will not mourn and will not be sorrowful. In other words, their death is known only in the city where they were a local celebrity and that is not enough to know their name. In other words, when someone dies, only in their city and town, they will mourn, if they were a local celebrity. On the other <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace in the midst of turmoil

To find peace, I need to quiet the voice within me which is in tumult. If the tumults of the mind be removed, the body may be at ease; but they, that do seek to remove the turmoil of their mind, must also be at rest.

In the world, all things are in a state of flux; nothing remains constant; and yet we must seek peace.

To seek peace is a thing that requires a good understanding of ourselves and of the world. He that doth know himself well, and the nature of the world, and the constitution of the universe, can find true peace; and can make good use of such peace, as far as it can last.

The mind, that doth truly seek peace, is not troubled by the troubles of the world.

We must seek peace with ourselves; and that which doth bring us peace, that is, the Word of God, and the sacraments; and those things also which are good, and suitable for a man to do.

I find peace when I am busy at my work, and not idle; for my mind is not idle, but is occupied with the thought of God.

<BEGIN> On the passage of time
We all are born as a little time in the world and the whole time is now and we all are dead, or shall be soon, and that is it.
For, as a man's life is to his reason and understanding as his body is to his senses, and so are the parts of his body as the parts of the earth. As the parts of the earth are more numerous and more varied; so are the parts of his body more numerous and more varied; but as the parts of the earth are more numerous, yet they are not more in number and quantity; and so are the parts of a man's body; and of these also, the greater part is in the earth, the rest in the body. For a man's body, when he is dead, is not one single whole, but many; and one body is the body of another, and another is the body of another, and so is it always, until it shall return to its origin; and as it returns, so shall all that is within him also be reduced.

For it is only through the help of a good and holy mind, that we can either give, or receive, a true and reasonable judgment of things; and therefore, if any one is so disposed, let him always endeavour to preserve a calm and composed mind; for if we be once more or less disturbed, our understanding is entirely confused.
It is a part of a good understanding, not only to understand, but to discern also. For to discern is a thing of much more importance and gravity, than mere understanding: For a man may have the understanding of a physician, without knowing, either to give or receive, any proper answer. A good understanding is therefore both a necessary condition, and a necessary consequence of a true and holy judgment.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger: the example of St. Paul.
On dealing with anger, St. Paul uses the example of himself. For he says, "Of that I was ready to be accused by the Jews, and to be condemned as a murderer; but God, who knew I was not a murderer, neither did suffer me to commit any murder, nor to be accused of any such things; therefore he doth well to hinder me. For if he had suffered me, I should have been ashamed and afraid: for I should have been in fear of the things which I have already said, that I was in the midst of many men, and that many men, were angry at me. Therefore now God will do well, if he doth not hinder me from continuing in that which I have begun, and to speak freely, and openly: that I may not be ashamed; and that I may have a good opinion of myself, that I have not been a murderer."
This is the manner of the ancients; they do not deal with any subject, as if it were of that kind. They speak it out, and then they leave it, as if it were nothing. The example of this is in the word of St. Paul. St. Paul says, "Of that <END>

On the nature of the universe, and the nature of man. The former is the latter. How can a man know, what is his own nature, when the nature of the universe, is the very same? What a difference is there, between a universe, and a man? a universe, is a universe, whatever be it, or whatever be its nature. a man is a man, whatever be he, or whatever be his nature. Thus if a man, be of one nature with the universe, he must be a universe himself. (From a Treatise of Human Nature. Part I. Sec. 7. By David Hume.)

From the treatise of David Hume, on the human nature. The human nature, is the human nature. The nature of the universe is the same nature.

<BEGIN> How to face death and the afterlife
It is difficult for man to come to terms with his own mortality. Many have asked why we must die. The answer is that death is part of the natural process of life. Just as flowers must eventually die, so must all living things. But we must not be afraid of death for if we are not afraid, we can live with confidence and peace of mind. If one does not fear death, what then is death? The answer is that death is simply the cessation of the breath. One cannot live without breath and therefore death is but the cessation of life. Death is not the end of life, but rather the end of a part of life. In fact, one may say that death is but an extension of life. The reason why it is so hard for us to accept the thought of death is that death is not understood. Death is not the end of the body, but rather the end of a part of the body. Death is not the end of the soul, but rather the separation of the soul from the body. Many who fear death are afraid that it will come suddenly. But if a man be in good health, and is free from all pains and suffering, it is but a natural process. And if it do come <END>

Wherefore the way of true order, that the true and proper order of things, is that a true and proper order, may be continued.

But as for the way, it is that a true order is such that, as I said, there is nothing that can happen, which is not in a proper order with that which is done, or is done.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence
St. Ambrose wrote: "It is a wonderful thing, that all men should be able to speak, without offending; and yet how many are there that offend, even from the very beginning, even from the very first breath of their mouth; and what can this be but that they speak much, but not well?"
In the beginning, I must confess that I was in the same state with others. I could speak much, but I did not speak well. I did speak much, but I did not speak truly; I could say many things that were not true; and I could say many things that were not kind; and many things that were not just. But in the beginning of the year, 1470, I began to see, that it was a great misfortune, that I could say many things, and yet speak no word. It is a wondrous thing, that it should be a virtue, and a thing of the highest value, that it should be, to speak a few, and to say much. And to the same purpose, our Saviour, saith, in the Gospel, "That which is true, be sure of it; and be sure that it is true; that which is false, be sure of it <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger
It is said that anger is not a pleasant thing. This is true. Yet if it is not removed, it will not be pleasant even after a long time. Therefore it is to be removed. (Folktale)

This is one of the wisdom sayings in the Buddhist scripture. The basic meaning is that when one's mind is angry, it will not be a pleasant experience after a long time. This is because a long time will have passed, but the mind has not been able to calm down and the mind is still angry.

This is why the Buddha says, "If you do not calm down your mind, then after a long time, the mind will have ceased to exist, and the consciousness will also cease to exist." The meaning is that if the mind does not calm down, it will not continue to exist for a long time.

The basic meaning of the Buddhist scripture is that, when one is angry, he should calm down, because anger will not be pleasant even after a long time. It is said in the Buddhist scripture, "When the mind is angry, the mind will not be pleasant, even after a long time, and the mind will have ceased to exist." This means that anger will not be a pleasant experience even after a <END>

(3) A world or a universe is either created, or created not; that is to say, either, that the divine power has wrought and formed it, or that it has been wrought and formed without any divine power. (4) The universe is either one, or many, that is to say, either it is one and simple, or many and composed. (5) If any one say, that the world or universe, that is, the whole world of matter, beeth created out of nothing, or beeth brought to pass by the mere power of God, then surely he is a true believer, and a true philosopher; for that is the very nature of God and of the world: (6) that the world or universe beeth created out of nothing, or that it be brought to pass, as he is, out of nothing. <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death with courage.
Death, being but a natural decay or resolution of all things, is not to be feared, for it is the natural end of all things, and as it is not to be feared, so neither can it be dreaded: It is a transgression to be afraid, or to be dismayed at death; for death, being but a transmigration of the soul into another body, doth not signify in it any harm: And if death be so, let not thy imagination be troubled, for death is not that which it is commonly conceived to be; but a change only, and not a change of the essential nature, as is to say, that it is not the end of a man; but rather the end of a man's flesh, and not of his soul, as a man, and as a rational creature, is not dead.

For death is not that which is called death by common men; for death is but the end of a man’s flesh, and not the end of a man’s soul, or of a man’s understanding. Death, in this sense, is a very pleasant and a very desirable thing; For the flesh may not be able to endure the hardships and troubles, that are occasioned by the world: But the <END>

<BEGIN> On logic and reason, the mind of man doth depend. All other things being equal, he is governed by the same general principles; which are the true foundation of all science and knowledge; but the mind is the true seat of this power: and therefore he is governed by them, only because they are the mind’s own property. For if he doth not obey them, he doth not obey that mind from whence they spring. For the mind, by her own nature and essence, doth make herself a mind; and from this very nature, and essence, doth she command all things. She is the selfsame, which all things are and are subject to. For it is not another self, that doth command, but that self, which doth itself command. She is the very self of all selfs; and the self of that self, which is not self, but all selfs are one. Therefore if she doth command all things, she doth but command herself: and the same command, is the command of all things: because all things are one self; and one self is all things.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless in modern times
The allure of fame in the modern age. Many are drawn to the idea of becoming famous, of achieving a level of stardom that brings with it the adoration and admiration of the masses. But in today's world, fame is a hollow and fleeting thing.

The reason for this lies in the nature of celebrity itself. In the past, a person's reputation was built on their character, their actions, and their accomplishments. A famous person was someone who had earned their place through their hard work and dedication, and was admired for their achievements and good character.

But in today's age, the concept of fame has become warped. We measure fame now by our social media following, by the number of likes and followers we have. This is a very shallow and superficial measure, and one that does not truly reflect the character or the quality of the individual.

Furthermore, fame in the modern age is often short-lived. Many people achieve a level of fame that lasts only a short time, and then they are forgotten. This is because the fleeting nature of fame means that it is only sustained by a constant stream of attention and media coverage.

In contrast, true fame and reputation is a lasting and enduring thing, built on the character and achievements of the individual <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace. Peace is not so much the object as the power and faculty of finding it. For to find it, thou must first have peace within; which thou canst not while thou art disturbed without. I think it is not strange that of the two, one should be able to find peace, but that they should be able to find both peace and a good understanding, is a more doubtful thing; but one thing is certain, that they cannot find peace, while they do not have a good understanding; and the one cannot have a good understanding, while they do not have peace; and so in effect, it is impossible for a man to find peace and a good understanding, till he hath peace and a good understanding. A man, therefore, must take heed not to disturb his own mind. The mind being the seat and the proper dwelling-place of the soul, how can it be that it should be disturbed? To whom can this be attributed? either to the angels and the spirits, or to the men that do truly follow Christ: for so it is not. For those angels and spirits, do truly follow Christ, but those men, that do truly follow Christ, are not such as can disturb themselves; because they have a good understanding, and a peaceable heart <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence. — Aristotle.
The more we shall suffer in the world, the more we must be diligent to keep silence, that we may not be distressed by any of those things. — Martin Luther.

The virtue of silence. — As to the virtue of silence, the truth is, that it is an easier thing for a man to speak than to think. The understanding is the greatest part of the mind; and the understanding is that which doth most easily pass over into sleep and into slumber, which are the states of the soul in its natural sleep. But if the understanding be put out of its natural state, and be set upon motion; then the soul is not only troubled, but it is also distressed: and what is distressed cannot speak. — Thomas Aquinas.

Silence is a divine operation. — Tertullian.

Silence is not only a necessary thing, but a virtue of a superior kind. For as every one must speak, yet so every one must speak also only with his proper and proper voice, so as not to offend those who are present; which is the chief part and first virtue of all that can be called silence. — Cicero.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain
Endurance of pain, and other passions, as they are called, is a virtue, and is both useful, and necessary in this world; that it is, and that it shall continue; that is, that the soul shall in its very nature be of an enduring, and eternal substance, and that the body, as it is a temporal and mortal substance, should be subject unto pain, and other like sufferings, in order to the health of the soul. And that it is a sign of a good and worthy constitution of nature, that the body should be so subject to pain and sufferings; that is to say, that it should not be so hard and stubborn, as a rock or a marble, but that it should be a body subject to pains and sufferings. The endurance of pain and of other passions, as it is a virtue, so also it is a sign of a good and worthy constitution of nature. And yet it is not every endu

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life, as if by the mere operation of Nature, and without the help of any man.
Of the things that happen, the most part of them happen not by any particular cause, but by the necessary operation of nature; or by some one, or some few of those causes, which happen in common to all things, as the generation of animals, or the dissolution of bodies. And it is true, that all things happen by natural necessity, or by that necessity, which is called necessary. But that is a thing, that is not the proper subject of observation and contemplation; it is the very essence and nature of things, which are to be observed. For it is not the things themselves, that are to be observed, but what in them is done; for the operation of nature is that which is to be observed. And it is true, that all things happen by the natural operation of the one and the same cause, that is the natural power or power, which is in every thing. And that is that power, that is called natural, and which is of that nature, which is natural.

Therefore all things happen of necessity; but not of any particular necessity. For a thing that is not the proper subject of observation, cannot be called any particular. <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger: the importance of time, self-control, and mindfulness.

Dealing with anger in a healthy way requires self-control, time, and mindfulness.

Anger is a natural human emotion that can serve a useful purpose, such as motivating us to take action to protect ourselves from harm or injustice.

However, uncontrolled anger can lead to a wide range of negative consequences, including physical illness, damaged relationships, and a lack of motivation.

To deal with anger in a healthy way, it is helpful to approach it in a mindful and intentional manner.

Mindfulness involves paying attention to our thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations, while also being aware of our surroundings and the world around us.

Practicing mindfulness can help us to better understand and manage our anger, by becoming more aware of its origins and the emotions that drive it.

Additionally, mindfulness can help us to cultivate self-control and time management skills, by teaching us to focus our attention and prioritize our tasks.

Self-control is a key aspect of dealing with anger, as it involves the ability to regulate our emotions and avoid impulsive behaviors.

By practicing self-control, we can reduce our anger and respond more thoughtfully to challenging situations.

Time management skills are also important in dealing with anger, as they allow us to prioritize our tasks <END>

How can we prepare to face death with equanimity?
As I reflect on death, I see that I am not afraid of it, because it is not for me to understand how it will come; nor do I seek to understand it, because if I should, I would not be able to bear it. I know that it is a change and a going forth into another kind of existence; that all flesh is mortal, that every living thing must sooner or later die, and that the very gods themselves must sooner or later cease to exist. I do not think of death, because if I should think of it, I should be troubled about it; nor do I seek it, for to seek it would be like a thing that is wicked and unjust. And now I will give thee an answer, which is like the answer of the wise and virtuous Pythagoras, to the question that was put unto him, How should I be able to die, when my mind and my soul are not yet ripe?

And one of those that had a hand in the death of the man, saw a lion, that was taken and led out, and put into a cage.  He said:  Why should that lion live, when this man did?  He that did this, was soon after cast out by the people, as a traitor and an enemy of the state.  Now, let us observe and consider the matter of the man that was taken, and put into the lion's den.  For a good reason and just cause, that lion did live; but the man, was put to death.

Now let this be understood of this one, as it is of the man that was in the lion's den.  That lion that did not come out, was cast into the very fire, that he should suffer for his cruelty.

Aristotle's opinion, and the opinion of his scholars, as it hath been received and imprinted by time, is as followeth.
They say that in all things, whether they be actions or passions, it is necessary that in every man's life, some time or other, there should be some action or some passion: for what is not action, nor passion, is not anything. For action, or action, or any other sort of thing, that is not action, or passion, is nothing, or nothing else, than action or passion; but it is not, and cannot be any other thing, than action and passion.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless and how to truly achieve greatness in your life
Fame is a fleeting, superficial phenomenon that often leaves individuals empty and unfulfilled. It can also be damaging to a person's mental health and relationships. True greatness, on the other hand, is about achieving lasting fulfillment and leaving a lasting impact. Here are some reasons why fame is meaningless and how to truly achieve greatness in your life:
1. Fleeting nature of fame: Fame is fleeting and ephemeral. It can come and go quickly, leaving individuals feeling empty and unfulfilled.
2. Superficial nature of fame: Fame is superficial and doesn't measure up to one's true potential or inner greatness.
3. Damage to mental health: Fame can be damaging to a person's mental health, leading to feelings of anxiety, depression, and isolation.
4. Damage to relationships: Fame can damage relationships, both personal and professional. Individuals who become famous may find it challenging to maintain meaningful relationships due to their newfound fame.

Why is true greatness important?

True greatness is important because it allows individuals to achieve lasting fulfillment and leave a lasting impact on the world. It is about making a meaningful difference in the lives of others, rather than seeking to impress and impress.

<BEGIN> On finding peace
and happiness.

From a true contemplation of God, the whole of human life is to be thought of as but an instant, and as short as the breath of life, so that from the beginning and end of all things, there is nothing more necessary, or more truly and properly part of it, than to live a life that is in harmony and concord, as much as may be, with the mind and will of God, according to His proper nature and essence. And such a life, as is most consonant to the divine will, is that which, in its every part and particular, is most purely and innocently virtuous, and is free from all corruptness and wickedness.

Therefore it is, that a true philosopher is not contented with a mere external holiness, or outward holiness only, as is usual with the common people; but seeks to be holier than that, and to have that true holiness, which is wrought out of the inmost part of the soul; for it is the heart of man, that is the seat of all true virtues, and the source of all that is truly good or just.

And it is well, that there is in man a natural desire, and an inclination to those things, <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is that it is the silence of all, and of those only, that are properly silent. It is not a mere silence of any man or any men, but the silence of those that are of one mind; those, that have all a common intention and understanding; those, that are of the same sect, the same denomination, and the same party. And they, that are properly silent, are those, that have nothing to say, that do not contradict one another, and that are not content to contradict the common mind and opinion of all the rest. But he, that is properly silent, must be a man, that is of a good mind, and a well-disposed man, and a religious man; and a man, that is well-inclined, and well-adapted to all times and occasions: and he, that is not properly silent, must be a man of great wit and understanding; a man, that is of a ready wit, and of a nimble and cunning understanding.

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life, or, An epitaph upon the common-wealth
A man's life is short, as all men do know. His time is but a moment, as all men's do know; and that very moment, is but a space of a few seconds; which is the time it doth take, for one thing to pass away; another, to pass on, and another, to come. As the clock, which is but a measure, doth not know the end, of itself; so the man's life also is but a measure, which doth not know the end, of itself. A man is born, a man doth die; a man is born, another man doth die; a man is born, and another man doth die. It is true, that some men do live a longer time; but it is true, also, that their life doth not consist of things of the body, but of things of the soul; and it is that which they do not so often, or so well, so use and enjoy, as to live a longer time.

The better to consider what is worthy of such a passion; for it is not the anger that is angry, but that which is angry, and that which is angry, doth not need to be angry.

Now if thou wouldst consider well, that anger is but a false cause, to be angry with, and a vain and ridiculous anger, to be angry at, that may be a sin; how then must a man deal with anger?

The soul, or vital principle, is not a part of the universe, but is distinct from it; and it is not a part of the world of nature, as things which exist and are subject to laws and causes, but is rather an essential part of the universe, a divine element that pervades and governs all things. For it is not merely an animal, or a living being, which is subject to death and corruption; but it is the principle of life and motion, the vital power, that makes any being alive. For death and destruction are not parts of life; and things which are subject to death and destruction are not alive, but are merely so many dead and corrupted bodies. That, therefore, which is subject to death and destruction, is not that which is truly and properly living and animated, but that which is only so many parts, or fragments, of that living and animated being, that is, that which is not itself a living being. But this, which is subject to death and destruction, is the same which is the material and body of that living and animated being. For from this body, as from the very root, all other bodies and parts are derived and made up. And thus also the <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death
The very fact of death is that which causes our natural fear, which we call fear of death. Of this I shall discourse in another place. Now, in the meantime, to speak properly, to die is that which is necessary to be done; or, as I said, to die, and to die again, are one and the same. Now, in this I say one and the same, to do a thing is to be bound by thy law, or thy judgment. To die, therefore, is to do thy natural part.
This is the true nature of death. A man doth live a natural life, or he doth not live. Either he lives, or he doth die; if he live, he doth perform his natural part; if he die, then he doth perform that which is natural and proper to his own life. What a wondrous thing is death, and what a strange thing is life; what a strange thing death is, that doth so suddenly cut off life. What strange, wondrous things are those, which in such a very short time are changed into death.

That is, that a man may be happy, as a man may be: which, it is not so easy, as a man may suppose. What is that which makes a man happy? The first thing, the natural. A man that is according to his natural, that is, as a man. So it was, as the Greeks used to say, that the god of the household. That is, a man that is according to his nature, that is, as a man. So then, in order to be happy, one must be able to be according to his nature, and, according to his nature, to be able to be happy.

Silence is not a lack of words, nor a want of speech, nor a fault in conversation, but a great virtue, which the Greeks called apatheia; which is an exemption from all passions and affections; which is also called anathematisis; for it is a separation, or a removal, and separation from the things, that move and stir the soul, and all the passions, and affections of the body and mind.

To be silent is to be still, and to cease to be moved, or agitated in the soul, as well as the body: and it is in the power of man, to make use of that silence, both for his own, and the other's benefit. And that is the cause, why the saints and prophets, and other holy men, and men of great wisdom and knowledge, are ever in such silence. And that also, which is done, by the birds and beasts, and all creatures. For they are in that silence, as in a true rest, and quietness of mind and body. For in that they are, all their affections, are calmed; and all their passions, are restrained, and quieted.

The endurance of pain is one of those things that can happen to anybody at any time.

If thou wilt bear it well, and not be troubled at the mention of it, I will endeavour to give an account of this matter.
For I have heard that there are some, who, when they have suffered in pain for many years, are not a little changed in themselves; their spirits are sunk, their affections are hardened, their will is made weak, their soul is hardened, and their life is brought to a close.
And I have heard also, that some there are, who are not so hardened, but yet do suffer long and grievously; their pains do not seem to be alleviated, and they do not find it easy to endure them; their spirits are still cheerful and happy, and they still bear the pain with patience and endurance.

This passage is quoted in the text of the Sermón of the Moste High and Mynorable Prince Edward, King of England, and of all the English, in the Yeare of our Lord 1348, as that which was said of Edward himself in those days. The King himself, in the year of his death, 1377, did not die for the reason why he did so. He died, and died so suddenly and hastily, that the manner of his death was not known unto many men. He was not murdered, nor did he die through any bodily hurt: for a man that had lived so many years in a common age and a common life, could not have been put to death. That, which he was put unto, was rather to be understood according to the common age and common life, which he did live.
St. Peter was not of a common life and age; but yet did he not die for a different reason from that of men of a common age. He was beheaded, for his having believed that which God had not commanded to be done.

In sooth, the anger doth itself contain the same principle and essence as the wrath which we do call anger. And therefore, as all the rest of the passions, so must it too be subject unto reason; lest, when anger hath once taken the reins of the soul, it doth carry the soul, and the actions, according to its own mind, and disposition.

The anger is, that is, the wrath; a kind of tumult or disturbance within the breast, a kind of swelling, that doth raise itself within, and doth spread its dominion over the rest of the soul. For when a man is angry, the rest of his actions are troubled and disturbed, and he doth either forget himself, or doth act otherwise than is meet and becoming. But if a man were not angry, his actions would be serene, and according to his own mind, and disposition.

Now, as all other passions, so also anger must be managed and governed, that it doth not carry the soul, and the actions, away to any unreasonable or unbecoming ends.

<BEGIN> How to face death with courage and strength of mind.
Death, being a part of our natural life, is that which is most familiar unto us: yet are men more fearful of death than of anything else. The reason of this, is, that man's life is his all, and his all is his life. Therefore, is the death of a man, as if he were to be cut off from himself, and to lose his all: which, when we consider, it is natural to be afraid. But yet, what can be more natural unto man, than to die? For there is nothing either in heaven or on earth, or under the earth, that can hinder him, either from dying, or from continuing to live. The time of death, is, according to the common estimation, a hundred years, or thereabout: but when is the time of death? This is not so much a matter of opinion, as of a fact, which is certain indeed, but not easily to be known. And therefore, this question, What can I do? or what can I say unto my own soul? to persuade her of that, which she is naturally afraid of. Let me answer thee, my soul: Thou must not be afraid of that, which is natural unto thee <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is not to have an opinion of his own, but to have an opinion of those who follow him; and, in truth, the true measure of a leader’s power lies not in what he himself can do, but in what he can do by the means of those who follow him: for it is as their opinion and disposition are, that it is in the nature of leaders to lead; but if their opinion is otherwise, their leader can never be a good leader, no matter how mighty he be himself.

In this passage, John Donne expresses the idea that a leader’s true power and ability depend not on his individual abilities, but on the abilities and opinions of those who follow him. This is often referred to as the "paradigm of leadership," where the leader's role is to empower and inspire those they lead. In essence, the leader is only as good as their followers.

This concept has been applied in many different contexts, including politics, business, sports, and even personal relationships. It highlights the importance of leadership development and building a team of talented individuals who share a common goal or vision.

In the context of our current topic of the Book of Psalms, we can consider how this principle is applied in the leadership of the Psalms themselves <END>

It is a question which hath been much debated, whether the world were originally created by one, or many, and in what manner they operated.

For that which hath happened in so short a time, and in a moment, can as reasonably be said to have happened, as that which is now in course: For what is the end of that which is now in course, but that which was before? For the end and the beginning is one. That which is, is that which was; and what hath been, is that which is not; and so all things pass on to and fro. That which is now in course, is that which was in its first beginning. And the time wherein it began, is the time in which all things are, or will be, made new.

For some men are altogether incapable of doing any good.
A wise and good man is such a one that is altogether capable of doing any good. The virtues are not without a common object.
If man has not an understanding to govern his actions, the laws of the land, or the decrees of his sovereign, are of no use to him. His will is his law. If man is governed by the law, the will of his sovereign, or the dictates of conscience, then is he a good man.
He that is capable of both good and evil, and acts according to his good nature, is a man of excellent courage. But he that only acts according to his good nature, is a man of good and virtuous courage. He is altogether a man of good nature, and good will, and is altogether good, and virtuous. <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain and suffering
The second form of endurance is the endurance of pain and suffering. Some suffer from pain, while others from affliction, sorrow, or distress. Some suffer from the hardships and difficulties of this life, which are innumerable, but not all of them grievous. Some are pained, some are grieved, some are oppressed, some are tormented, some are vexed, some are troubled, and some are altogether exhausted. Now the manly character consists not in being able to endure the least or smallest hardship, or pain, or suffering, but in being able to endure that which is great, or grievous, or most difficult.
And the reason why the mind is unable to bear that which is most difficult, is that it is unable to endure any thing which is not agreeable unto it. But to bear anything, which is not agreeable unto it, is to bear any thing that is hard; and therefore to endure that which is most difficult, is to be able to bear any hard thing. For that which is hardest and most difficult, is the hardest and most difficult of all things; and that which is hardest of all things, is that which doth not agree unto the mind; and therefore that which is hardest of all <END>

For in a good cause and good right, is it not reasonable and justifiable to be angry? But in a bad cause and a bad right, it is most unreasonable and unjustifiable.

We are forced to be constantly in the public eye, to be on our guard at all times, to be constantly looking over our shoulders, and to be always "on." And this is a terrible way to live, to be constantly "on" and to be under the pressure of constant scrutiny.

But the thing is, we're not as unique as we think. We all have the same desires and fears. And when we try to rise above these things and become famous, we are doing precisely the same thing. We are seeking the same things that we all seek: love, happiness, meaning, and fulfillment. And it's this that makes fame a hollow thing. For fame is merely a symbol of our desire for love, happiness, meaning, and fulfillment.

And when we try to find these things outside of ourselves, as if they were located in something else, we miss the fact that they are located inside of us. We are not made to live our lives in a world where we <END>

(Anon.)

What is life, say you? The common multitude may say it is the breath, and the breath, the breath. And it may be that they have spoken right. But that we may know, we must look further. The breath is but the wind, and the wind is but the air; and the air, a mass of matter, void of form, and without figure. In what manner, therefore, must it be, that this air or mass of matter, or wind, should constitute the very essence of life?

This question may seem trivial, or but of little importance, to a common man. But it is of the greatest importance, to him that seeketh to understand the nature of things; and to him that wouldst know, what is the essence of life.

One would naturally suppose, that the man that is angry is better than he who is not angry; for the man that is angry, hath a passion so common among mankind; and such as every one doth feel and know. But, 0, that which doth move this common passion, doth move the particular one, with a particular passion; and not with the common one. A man, that is angry, is moved by a particular passion; but a man, that is not angry, is not moved by it at all. And this is the first rule, how one ought to deal with anger; namely, not to be moved by any thing, which doth move any one else. If thou be angry at another, take heed, thou shalt be angry at thyself; and if thou be not angry, take heed, thou shalt be angry, if any one else be angry at thee. But it is not to be understood, as if thou wert to be angry, if any one else were angry at thee; but this only, that thou wert to be angry at thyself.

If they do not believe that there is no God at all, either, so that there are not any gods but one, but that there is one only, then are they either absolutely ignorant, or utterly wicked; because, as for their ignorance, they are not able to see how one only God cannot be, which doth all things in all places, so that there should not be any other God but one: but as for their wickedness, they must be, that do not believe any thing, for that is true wickedness.

<BEGIN> How to face death: The way of the Stoics.
Stoicism is an ancient Greek philosophy that emphasizes reason, self-control, and indifference to external events. The Stoics were concerned with the proper way of living. This involved a constant exercise of the understanding, a self-examination, and a living of such a life as might lead to death or retirement with honour.
Death is an opportunity, a way to be set free from a world that is full of troubles, full of envy, full of hatred, full of lust, and full of many other evils.
The fear of death is a mere dream. He that can apprehend death with equanimity and temperance, that can see the good that may follow, is able to make himself and others happy.
The Stoics did not wish to avoid death, but to meet with it in the most dignified and manly way. For it is written, That men in ancient times were not afraid of death. (Acts i. 2).
To live as the Stoics do, is to live the life of man, who is a part of the universe; to live the life of one that is governed by the reason of the universe. For to live the life of man is not to live in vain, but to <END>

The justice that is the principal, is that which relates unto the common right and justice of nations, and that of private persons. A king must also take care, for the true faith, and the true worship of God; and must defend and uphold it. He must also care for the true religion. A king must not only defend his own kingdom, but also other kingdoms. He must also use his power, and authority, in order to the peace and happiness of the people. A king must not only maintain the laws of his kingdom, but also of other kingdoms. He must also observe all the laws of nature. A king must not only provide for his own kingdom, but also for the safety of the whole earth.

Whom, if thou wilt examine thyself, thou shalt find to be one of them that have been guilty of ignorance and absurdity. For, in matters of opinion, no man ever can be ignorant; and in matters of fact, no man ever can be mistaken; for they are both things of absolute and universal truth. For either a man must be either ignorant or certain; if certain, then not only so must the truth be known to him, and known to him upon his own knowledge; but if the truth is known to him, then must also the contrary be known, or else how can the one truth know and assert itself? For then must the other, which is false, and contrary to the one, must know itself: and this is impossible. And so, in matters of opinion, all men must be either ignorant of the true opinion, or of the false; and of the true, not the false; and not of the false, but of the true.

He therefore is truly able, and worthy of his place, and of that great personage, who is said to have the power to make his own words of no value; for that also, and that power of speaking, which is of no other use, but only to give pleasure unto men, is of himself sufficient. To give pleasure is the proper end of all speech. To speak, is but an ordinary way to give pleasure.
From the discourse of this last writer, it may be seen, that the proper end of speech is pleasure; and that which is pleasing, is that, which doth correspond with the desires and inclinations of men; and that is, which doth correspond with their common reason. And therefore, that which doth correspond with common reason, must also be pleasing.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless?
Fame is a mere noise in the world. What is fame, but a fleeting fancy and an empty honour? It is but a brief interval, and soon is forgot. And though it doth make men proud, and doth bring many unto a higher estate, it is but a temporary and fleeting thing, and of no true value. The true honour of any man, is that which cometh of his own actions, and doth arise from his own merits. To be truly great, is not to be called great, but to be truly worthy of such a name. That is the proper use and end of a great man, to be great for himself and for his own actions, not for the mere praise and commendation of others.

— Matthew Henry

Fame is the very thing that makes men proud and vain; and this is but a part of the general vanity of man. For as for other things, it is all one to me, whether a man be a king, a commoner, a bishop, or any other; what soever he be, is no more than a man. For as soon as he dies, his reputation and memory perish together. And so all other things are but temporary and fleeting, that are not grounded upon <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace with the inevitability of death
In our common speech, men often say and do things that can only be understood as having a deep meaning and significance, for which they must use many and varied arguments. But is not that also true of the whole of nature, and of the course of the world? Must it not be governed by the same rules and principles which are observed in the affairs of men? For what is death to us, but to be separated from our souls; and what is life to us but to be together with our souls? And how can this separation be avoided? Either we must live forever, and so be united with our souls in this life, or else we must be separated from them hereafter, as from a part of ourselves.

Happiness is that of the soul, not the body. A happy life is that wherein the soul is happy; and this is that which is true happiness.

The true happiness of men is that of the soul, not that of the body. For if it is true, that the soul of man is a part of the divine, and is a holy and celestial thing; as the body, on the other hand, is earthly and brutish; then, it follows that the happiness of the soul, must <END>

Some have thought, that as men's bodies were subject to decay, and as their bodies were subject to death: that, therefore, their souls must also subject to decay and death. But it is not so; because it is not the nature of the soul, to pass into non-existence, or to cease to be: it is, however, not so that it cannot continue, but for ever, and for eternity, and for ever. For the soul, which is the true self of man, is a spirit, or a divine. For that which is spirit, and divine, cannot be subject, or subject to decay. For if the soul, were subject, or subject to decay: then must it, also, be subject, and subject, to death; for a spirit, is, indeed, not subject to decay; but to the power and dominion of God; and is subject only, to the power and dominion, of the divine and eternal Spirit of God; that is, to that spirit, which is, and that which is eternal: and that which is eternal, and that which is eternal, must also, be subject, to no other power, or dominion, than to that of the divine and eternal Spirit of God, <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is very much to be wished, and endeavored after; because it is a thing both agreeable and profitable unto a man. To keep silence, and not to speak much, is the natural disposition of a wise man. But to be silent and mute, and to keep silence only in the matter of truth, and not to be silent and mute in any other matter, is a thing to be feared and avoided.
To speak and to keep silence are two things, so different, that they are hardly to be compared; for it is one thing to speak out of love, and another to speak out of hatred; and it is one thing to speak out of wisdom, and another to speak out of folly. To speak out of love, is a most agreeable thing: for in that also is a part of the body, and in that also is the breath and voice of man; and as all living creatures have the power to speak, so has man also that power. Therefore, to speak out of love, and to keep silent, is most agreeable and most natural unto man.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain or suffering.
Endurance is a hard thing, both in itself and in respect to its effect; it is hard, both, first, because the pain itself is hard; and secondly, because, as long as it lasts, there is a continuation of the pain. Of such a nature are those sufferings, which are called continual, perpetual, and infinite sufferings; as innumerable and eternal pain, as well as such as are called, by the name of torment, and such, as the pangs of the worm. These, then, are such, as that, for the time they are used, the pain itself, is the greatest part of it; but for the time of the pain, that is to say, how long it doth continue, is the greatest part of it.
To the pain itself is added another pain, of a very different sort, and more bitter than the former. The one is a pain of the body, the other is a pain of the mind.

Some there are, whose object is not the good of men. They do not regard at all how any man may be affected; nor do they use any means to preserve any man's life, nor to preserve any man's health; and yet it is possible they should do them much good.

This dialogue, or rather the three philosophers themselves, is a faithful picture, that we may take, of the nature of the world. The first philosopher, or the world, is the sun; the second, the moon; and the third, the earth.
That which is in common, to all the celestial bodies, is, their natural constitution, and the natural constitution of their particles, that is, their elemental nature; that is to say, the earth, air, and water.
The earth is the matter of the earth, that is to say, of the earth itself: the air is the matter of the air; and the water the matter of the water. The earth being earth itself, is by nature earth itself; and the air air itself; and the water water itself. It is then, by this natural constitution of their particles, that these three, are the three material parts of the whole world.
In this also, is to be noted, the particular nature of each, and its difference from that which is common. That the earth, in particular, is the material, of the earth, is so by reason of its constitution, that is, of its being earth <END>

The way to face death is to know, that thou dost die by a natural and proper decay of thy natural body. Thou art not slain by a violent hand, but by the natural course of that very life that is in thee; which is but a proper instrument, and an instrument of the great God, that is the Author and Saviour of all men.

Consider, that death is not any one thing, but a collection of many things; as a violent death, an unnatural death, a sudden death, and a violent death by a stroke.

If thou wouldst not be slain by any one of those, consider thyself well, and in good health; if not, seek unto thy physician and apothecary for a remedy, and for a medicine against death and death's sting.

If it happen, that thou shouldst die by a violent hand, as in war, or by some accident; consider the same of the death of the many, for as many men die by a violent hand, as by a natural death; and for as many are slain, as are slain by the plague.

To follow is easy, but to lead is hard; but there are few of those who have the power of leading, because they are not willing to take the trouble.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless.
Fame is a thing that is both wondrous and pitiful. A man that is famous is always in the presence of multitudes; yet his fame doth not so much as comfort or benefit him. For though fame is the common fame of all mankind, and the common opinion of all men, which doth follow their own opinions, and their own fancies; and though it be a fame of a very great and excellent sort; yet is it as common to any man as it were a breath, or a sound; and therefore doth it afford him no comfort or benefit.

Therefore, as for a man, when he is famous, he is like a bird that is gilded with gold and precious stones, and yet doth he find it not so precious, as his own feathers are; and though it doth bring him many compliments, yet it doth not so much as bring him comfort: For he is not only gilded with gold and precious stones, but he is also gilded with flattery; but for all that he doth not so much as find it pleasant.

For how can that man, who doth seek for peace, or find it, if there be anything that doth disturb the rest of the universe? For in all the parts of the universe, all is in harmony, and all things do agree in themselves: and there is not one part of it, that doth not contain, or produce all the rest.

To him also, that in his particular self, he doth find peace and rest, he shall find it elsewhere also. For that self of his, which he doth call his, is but a shadow or a copy, of that, which is truly himself. He that doth truly find rest and peace, is he that is truly his own self. He is he, that is not distracted, nor divided from himself. And he shall not find rest, if he be troubled with any false or false appearances.

When shall the time come? when shall the hour arrive? and what shall then happen? I will not know, nor shall I be able to do anything, because I am a simple man and ignorant of all things.

To be silent is better than to be full of idle words: for the best of men are not always full of words, but they are full of actions and deeds: and their words and deeds are always in harmony, that the words of one may not contradict the deeds of another. For men, that are not always speaking, are more at peace, than men that are always speaking. For every word that man doth speak, there is a reason for it, and a cause for the reason. If one speaketh, it is not without reason, that he speaketh; for his reason is one thing, and the cause of the reason another. To be silent is better than to be always speaking, and speaking, that no man shall believe, but that they have in their hearts some other meaning, than what they do say.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger: what can we say?

One can say nothing more, but a brief exhortation. Take heed, and be not unmindful. Remember that every man that is angry, is a man of evil disposition; that those who do not strive to be composed, are more likely to be angry, than those who do. Let every one who doth strive to be composed, use all the means which are in his power: not only to keep a secret, and to do nothing that may stir up wrath and indignation in others; but also to keep his own heart and mind from anger; and, if it doth happen, to seek peace as soon as possible, and to strive for it, rather than for wrath and anger. For if wrath and anger be a thing that doth happen unto a man, it is much better to be in peace, than in wrath or anger. And it is much better to be in a state of peace, than in a state of wrath or anger, for it is better for a man to be in a state of peace, than in a state of wrath or anger; for then will he have time to seek peace; and to keep a secret. And it is much better to be in a state of peace, <END>

Whose benefit, and honour, this work is dedicated, let it not be supposed, that such a volume of discourse, as this is, is properly fit and necessary to be read by every ordinary person.

But that such a treatise, as this is, may be a benefit and advantage to those who desire and seek to know the secrets of nature, it is enough to know, that it may be a common stock, and storehouse of knowledge.

A common stock and storehouse of knowledge

How hath the world ever been able to prosper and flourish, if all men had not agreed, and concurred, in the common pursuit and pursuit of knowledge, which is the proper end and end of the human species.

But if the world, or any part thereof, ever did prosper and flourish, in a greater degree, than in the former ages, it is evident that the common knowledge, or understanding, and discourse, among the men of those times, was more universal, and more perfect, and more according to the nature and proper end of man, than it was in any former age.

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is to encourage their people. When a leader is present in a community, he should make sure to encourage the people of that community by giving them the freedom to express their opinions. There are many types of leaders, each with their unique personality and methods of leadership.
Some of the qualities of a good leader include honesty, integrity, transparency, accountability, fairness, justice, courage, patience, and humility. A leader should always be willing to listen, to learn from others, and to admit when they are wrong. A good leader is a good teacher. The leader should encourage their followers to do the same to them.
The great leader, Abraham Lincoln, was known for his honesty, integrity, and fairness. He always stood by his principles, never backed away from them. He also gave his people the freedom to express their opinions and made sure that they were able to live their lives with dignity and respect.
Another great leader was Nelson Mandela. Mandela was a black African who fought against the white domination of his people. He spent 27 years in prison and then became the leader of his people, bringing about a new era of peace and harmony.

Whosoever, therefore, will truly reason, must know that there are certain things that are absolutely certain, or, in other words, that there is something, in respect whereof one can never err; and this is nothing else, but that God is and hath always been true and just; and this must be known, not only for the purpose of argumentation, but for the very substance of knowledge; for there are no other things certain and certain, but God and His ways.
Of this subject the philosopher Origen and the doctor Tertullian have written; but their writings are not in such form, as they may be of easy apprehension to every one.
Of the true and true, there is but one, and that is God. Whosoever, therefore, is not of that true and true, is not true at all. (Dag. 7.) (Cyprian.)

We are so far from being able to judge whether others truly repent, or not, and truly abhor, and truly fear God; and so far from being able to determine, whether they truly love their neighbor, and truly will to do him good, that, in so many places and amongst so many men, there doth appear an extraordinary diversity. Some indeed of these men are true lovers of God, and of men, and of this world; and they do truly love their neighbor, and do truly desire to do him good: others indeed do not truly love God, nor truly love their neighbor, nor truly desire to do him good; but are so far from true repentance, and true abhorring, and true fearing God, and so far from true love of their neighbor, and true desire to do him good. For as a man is far from knowing what the nature, the will, the design, and the disposition of another is; so also a man is far from knowing, and judging, what is the nature, the will, the design, and the disposition of those that are not himself.

Fame is a thing most fleeting: as the seasons. For now the world is full of them; and all of them shall soon be no more. But when those shall be gone that are now alive, what shall remain, as the substance of their fame? That also shall be soon dissolved. For if that be destroyed which gave them their fame, their fame is destroyed also; or at the most it is only preserved to be told of in the memory of the world.

I will be a man that shall be forgotten.

It is the duty of a man of letters to be always seeking out of that which he shall be told of; and to remember it: but it must not be for the sake of seeking of it, nor for the sake of remembering it, but rather that he may the better forget it, and to have the time to tell it again when he shall have had a good opportunity.

That which is true, is that which is spoken of as a true thing. But that which is spoken of as a true thing, is not that which is truly true.

And howsoever the particular friend that is absent should be, or may be absent, from this union and amity of their minds and spirits, his absence is not such, but as, in the time of his absence, his own mind and spirit are not present. And here I would put you in mind, as the matter requires, of that sweet and mutual love and friendship which doth exist and continue, between the hearts of Christ and His church, between God and man: in so much that, even as Christ, in His death and passion, did suffer for his church, and in his resurrection did deliver his church, and so doth God, in the very same manner, suffer for His church, and so doth His church, in her true and spiritual resurrection, according to the promise of the gospel, rejoice and triumph.

As, therefore, we may speak of death in the spring, so we must speak of death in the winter; that it may be known unto all, that the life of man is but a span, and that it doth end as soon as it beginnes.

It is true, that all human creatures have their endowments and gifts, and those, which are more exquisite and delicate, require a more subtle and fine handling, and care and management, to preserve their virtues and qualities, and to promote their own perfection. And yet, in this respect, and for the sake of their delicacy, are many a thing of a very cruel and brutish nature, which would be, were it not for some particular disposition and constitution, not altogether without some defect, that they cannot help, but doth serve them for the preservation and exercise of their finer and more exquisite faculties. For though it is a thing of great pain, and grievous and irksome, yet it is also a thing of great use and utility, to the end that their more delicate and fine parts may be preserved and preserved.

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life; or, The way of death; and of the after-life and eternal life
Hobbes, Thomas
Of all things, the chiefest part, is the eternal life: or life everlasting; not, as some will have it, only to be understood by the continuance of a natural life, or the duration of a rational and sensitive soul; but in truth, a life ever, living; evermore. And then that which is most of all, both of body, and of mind, is life itself. All else is but as it were life; that which is but a part of life, that is, of body or mind; but to that which is really life, that is, life everlasting, that is, to the life hereafter.
To begin with, consider, what life is. What is that which doth in the world, and in every man's own life? Is it not a going, or moving from place to place? A going of a man from one place of rest to another? And that also of a body, or a soul; a going from one place of rest, or contentment, to another.

What is it that angers men? Is it their nature, or is it anything else?  And what are the causes of that anger, or irritability, which they say they cannot help? Is it not, that they have not enough reason?  They are all capable of reason; for all men are naturally so, and all capable of virtue.  But they that have not enough, are altogether without reason and all the parts of reason, are altogether corrupt.  And that which corrupts a man, is corruption, or the corrupter.  But that which is the corrupter, is the power or the act of the corrupter.  Now, the power of the corrupter, is that by which he corrupts and defileth.  And the corrupter is that, which corrupts and defileth.  Now, corruption is the power, and the power is that by which they corrupt and defile.  But they cannot corrupt and defile, but by that which they corrupt and defile, so also cannot they corrupt and defile, but by the power of the corrupter.

For, all corruptness is from some one and the same corrupter:  The corrupter, corrupting, defile <END>

How to die with dignity, is the true question; how to make death an occasion of joy to ourselves, and to those whom we love, is that which should be the main thing to be aimed at in this life. For to live, is nothing to a man that doth not consider his death: as death, is nothing but a part of the whole life that is to pass and pass away. As long as we live, we must live well; but when we have once gone out, all things are ended. Let us then learn to make our lives as agreeable to God, as any life can be: and to make our dying, as agreeable to God, as our living ever was.
How to face death, is but an easy matter to any man that truly knoweth himself: For when men begin to think of death, they begin to think of themselves; and thus to look upon themselves in the glass, they see themselves as they truly are; and thus they are made sensible of their former life; of the many sins that they have committed, and of the many sins that others have committed; of the many temptations that <END>

In the year 1642. I do not find any. For there was a man, which did preach unto the people, and that man was John of the cross: he was a very zealous and rigid Pharisee. And when he went unto the temple, he was wont to say, “Blessed are they, which desire to come unto me, and to be reconciled unto me”. and “Whatsoever thy hands do, and whatsoever thy feet do, do not do according unto the flesh, but according unto the spirit.”. Now this was said of one of his followers, who was of that kind, as was to say: “A man of God. He was a man of God. He was a man of God. He was a man of God”.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless. It is a mere shadow or imitation of true greatness. This is a thing that is easy to discern in those who have made any considerable progress in their several studies, that it is a thing of a different and lower sort, than what the wise and worthy man, who hath a true and great genius, doth usually pursue. For when a man hath obtained a true greatness, he doth not need of any external things, such as praise, riches, and power, to make him happy, but is perfectly contented, and at ease, within himself, and doth pursue his own proper business, with a good heart, and a happy mind. But if any man be contented with any thing of a lower sort, it is a sign, that he doth not possess a true greatness, but is of a mean and inferior kind. A great man's greatness, is not to be measured by his wealth or his power, but by his understanding and wisdom. A great man, doth not care for the praise or commendation of any man; but doth seek for true knowledge and understanding. A great man, doth not care for the fear of man, but doth seek for true religion and virtue. A great man, doth not <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace, I find that, for the most part, my mind is not troubled. The thing which usually troubles me, whether I be walking, or sitting, or in my bed, is, that I do not know how I can be in peace for ever. A peace of mind is of itself a kind of torment to me, if it be not tempered with some consideration, whether it shall be long lasting. How this can happen, and how long it will last, I know not. Some would say, it must be so, if it be so; others, if not so, how it can happen, I know not. Neither can I tell, whether it can ever be so; nor whether it ever was so. For we do not know, what is the true constitution of things.

It is a thing most strange and hard to believe, that there is any one, that doth not desire to be happy; but it is a thing most common, that the understanding and memory are not sufficient for the true happiness of life.

How then must I not be, and that very properly, grieved and vexed at the passing of that which has already happened, and the things that yet to be shall happen, that I am to make such and such an account of, that the true and just are chosen and approved of?

The silence that is good, is such, as is used by those, who are in a good conscience: as is the silence of the angel, that dwelt upon the cherubim; as is the silence of the holy spirit. For so also must we speak in our hearts. And this silence of the heart is that, which is commonly called, the conscience. And he who hath a good conscience, that is a man of good conversation; and he who hath an evil conscience, that is a man of evil conversation.
The silence of the heart is a sign of a good conscience. The tongue is a part of the body, as the hand is of the body.

Many men are angry, and yet they are neither angry, nor in a passion, nor any way inconsiderable, but a part of those which are angry for the reasons and ends that I have already mentioned. (Cicero)

For, as a man's anger, and wrath, may often be a plague unto them, so it can also be a remedy unto some other, that may be afflicted with a worse kind of plague. (Bacon)
All that is good and excellent in man, is not only in his mind and understanding, but also in his will and appetite; and they must all be in harmony one with the other. And the harmony and agreement between the mind, and will, and appetite, are to be preserved and maintained, by the exercise of reason and good understanding. (Campanella)

Death is the end of all worldly cares, and all worldly vanities and frivolities. It is the end of all worldly vanities and pleasures.

As the good and noble philosopher, Epicurus, doth say, "Death is the greatest happiness that man can know."

A true Christian, doth believe that death is but a change, and that it is a change from a life of sin and misery, to a life of holiness and happiness. A true Christian, doth know that death is a change from a life of worldly vanities, and a life of sinful courses, to a life of righteousness, and a life of holy and virtuous deeds.

It is also to be noted, that a true Christian, doth believe that death is an occasion of the resurrection of the body, and the resurrection of the soul, and that it is a change of the life, which is but for a short time, and which doth pass away as soon as it is done.

In the first place, a leader should set an example in justice; a good judge and a wise man, should set an example to his subjects, in justice, equity, and the right ways and means of proceeding in the administration of justice, and in the use of good and sweet manners towards all men. For this and for these other reasons, a leader, or a governor, must be just, wise, good, and charitable, that he may set a good example, and be an example to others. For if any one shall do anything in the way of justice, or equity, or righteousness, but shall not be willing that he may set an example, and that his way of doing may be followed by others, and that they may also follow after him; then shall that person be without justice, equity, and righteousness.

of that which is spoken to be in a manner of a reason, that it be in a manner of a thing of sense. And that the same that is the ground and foundation of all discourse and reasoning, should also be the foundation and ground of that which is of sense.

## Step 1: Understand the context
The passage is part of a larger work that deals with logic and reason. The author is addressing William Camden, and the work is a discourse of two chapters.

## Step 2: Analyze the passage
The passage is about the nature and power of reason. The author is discussing what makes something a "reason" or a thing of sense. They are pointing out that just because something is a matter of sense, it does not automatically mean that it lacks reason.

## Step 3: Identify the main argument
The main argument is that reason and sense are not mutually exclusive, and that the same thing can be both a reason and a matter of sense.

<BEGIN> On the behavior of others in the presence of a tyrant: a treatise

The first part of this book is a discourse, or rather a treatise, concerning the nature and constitution of tyranny, and what are the effects of a tyrant among his subjects. It is a general discourse, and contains many things that are very proper and pertinent unto this subject. And it may please thee, if thou wilt but attend unto it, that thou shalt easily understand, what is tyranny, and what a tyrant is; and what are the qualities, or characters that belong unto him. It is also a discourse concerning the power of tyranny, and what is the power of it; and what are its effects, both among itself, and among the subjects. And the second part is a discourse, or treatise, concerning the manner of tyranny, or the practice, or the power, of a tyrant. It contains the true nature and essence of tyranny. And it is a discourse, not only concerning the tyrant, but also concerning his subjects, and how they should behave themselves in the presence of a tyrant.

But of this, we shall speak more fully, as it is a subject of great import. But now, thou shalt take heed, to attend unto the first discourse, and <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
In the 1980s, I became involved with the punk rock movement. It was a time of great upheaval, rebellion and experimentation in music and fashion. As a result, I was exposed to a lot of young people who were deeply passionate about the scene. Many were driven by a desire to be a part of a subculture, a way of life and a sense of community.
But for some, the pursuit of fame in the music scene became a major goal. Some started writing songs with the intention of getting noticed by record companies, or by being discovered at a gig, so they could get signed. This is when fame began to take on a different form. The motivation that drove so many of them to get noticed was not out of a genuine desire to do something meaningful or to make a difference in the world. For some it was to become famous. And that, I believe, is why fame can be meaningless.
Fame has always been a driving force. It has always been a key motivator for many. Many people have set their sights on achieving fame and fortune. And it is often this that has driven so many of them to make decisions that are detrimental to the people around them. The pursuit of fame can lead people to neglect their personal <END>

Of the power and dignity of God: and how God and man are both united in Christ. Of the immortality of the soul. And of the resurrection of Christ.
First, of the peace of mind and the contentment of the mind, which are so essential to the well-being and happiness of man, and are yet so rarely found.

Of the true nature of man. First, his physical body; which is a mere vehicle of the spirit. And secondly, his rational and understanding part; which is endowed with reason, and understanding. The former is but a machine, the latter is a living and rational being.

His character and duties are plain; but to discharge them properly is not easy. For the reason and understanding of man are prone to err; and the spirit and soul are prone to vanity and pride.

His proper object is Christ: the only true and proper object of the heart and mind.

Of the power and dignity of God: and how God and man are both united in Christ.

Of the immortality of the soul. And of the resurrection of Christ.

Of these particular degrees, of which the circumference of the earth is divided into three parts, I shall speak more particularly. (St. Augustine)

In his first epistle, (Epistle I), he had inquired of the brethren of the blessed and blessed man, Augustine of Hippo, whether the things that are spoken, which the blessed Augustine had spoken of the blessed Peter, the blessed Paul, and others, were spoken of him who was, or of him who should be, or of them both? Whether they should be understood to speak of that, who in this world, hath lived before the time of the blessed Augustine; of that who should be before the time of the blessed Augustine, but yet after the time of Peter; of that, who in this world hath lived before the time of the blessed Augustine; of that, who should be before the time of the blessed Augustine, but yet after the time of Peter; of <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain: The importance of perseverance in the face of suffering
Endurance of pain is a highly valued trait in many religious and philosophical traditions. It is seen as a way of demonstrating one’s faith, commitment, and character in the face of suffering. In the context of Christian theology, the endurance of pain is often associated with martyrdom, the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, and the self-denial of saints. However, it can also refer to the everyday suffering that people face as a result of natural disasters, accidents, illnesses, and other hardships.

In the Buddhist tradition, endurance of pain is one of the key components of the Eightfold Path, and is seen as a way of cultivating mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. The Buddhist concept of suffering, or dukkha, is an inherent part of life, and is not something that can be eliminated. Rather, it is seen as an opportunity for spiritual growth and transformation.

From a secular perspective, endurance of pain is often seen as a sign of strength and resilience. People who are able to persevere through difficult situations are often viewed as more capable and admirable. This perspective is reflected in the popular saying, "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."

The importance of perseverance in the face of suffering is not limited <END>

What is there that can be so hurtful, so vexatious, or so troublesome, that it can not be expressed in one word? It is enough to make thee in sorrow, and to fill thee with such an unwillingness to die, that thou mayest even say: O how many years shall it be ere I can die! A man that is not yet a man, and whose life is already in his prime, cannot but be vexed. What is the life of a man that is not yet a man! What is a man! A man is a man, that is to say, a living thing, or a spirit. How soon are we all going to be spirits! And so indeed it must be, as soon as the bodies be dissolved. But, as for those spirits that we now see, they are very short lived, as every man that is born, must certainly die; and of that, every one is so conscious. What is the life of man? A life that is short and fleeting: a life that is full of troubles and vexatious cares: a life that is full of death, and a death that is full of <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger: If thou canst not bear the anger of thy servant, do not give him time to be angry, but give him thy servant’s pay in a short time. For though thou shouldst pay him in a long time, yet thy servant is more angry when thou dost not pay him soon, and therefore in the end he is not contented with the payment that he receiveth.
Hence is it, that many of the ancient Greeks and Romans did not respect themselves, nor did they value their own lives, for fear that they should lose their money; for they could not endure to be without money; because they were afraid lest they should be undone, and they thought their lives not worth a penny.

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe, it is well known, that all things are made of matter, that all things do act upon one another, that all things do operate by the action of the universe. In the same manner as one man doth act upon another, so doth the universe, or rather, that which doth act for and upon all, doth act upon one another, and also upon the whole universe. All this therefore is true, that the whole universe, is in one universal motion or operation. But it is not sufficient to have a universal motion, unless that the same motion, be not always in the same way, and by the same means, and according unto the same order, which doth exist, both in the matter and in the form. For in such a manner, it is not true, that the whole universe is moved. But the whole universe, is moved, as soon as it hath a motion, and hath a motion in the way and manner, which doth exist, and which is, of itself. Thus, if thou considerest, that a particular man, hath a motion, in the way that he doth walk, in the way that he doth run, in the way that he doth fly; then surely, if thou <END>

The first part of the dialogue, where the philosopher of the city, Socrates, is put into his coffin, and carried into the house of his wife, where his friends and relations were. The philosopher, who had no fear of death, as was proved, before, had now, when he was going to be carried away, made the following address unto his wife and all his friends. This is what he said. - Oye, friends and wife. I praye you, make a merry cheer and good will. I shall be a merry man, even in the death of my body. For I am not afraid of any death, and therefore I have no sorrow, that is a true and constant sorrow, for death. But I have sorrow, that is but temporary and transient, for the things that I have omitted. For I have not omitted anything of the kind, that can cause sorrow unto any man. I have not omitted anything of the kind, that can cause sorrow unto any man. I have not omitted anything, but what the law of nature would not permit. And for the things, that I have omitted, I am sorry unto myselfe, not unto any other man. For it is not a true and constant sorrow, to remember those <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is not only to preserve the lives and limbs, but also to preserve the property and estate of their subjects. (Aristotle)This is one of the most beautiful and most instructive things that ever was said. If they should neglect this part, what care they, that they preserve the bodies of men, or their lives and limbs, if they can preserve the property and estate of their subjects? and therefore is this part of the law, that all men should have some estate, as the soil of their native country; some rents, or a portion of some of their father's property; and some other revenues, or sources of money, out of their own property. For without these revenues and sources, there is not enough left to any man to live with any credit, or reputation; and withal they must also be subject to the will of the king, without any security or protection of their own.

Some may say, that it is not reasonable to expect a king to be a good provider. For how can he do that, that is but a king, and not a farmer? And yet it is reasonable to expect from him, to provide for those that are his subjects, for which he was set up in the world. For without this, he is <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
Fame is an empty word, an empty thing. Fame, as such, is nothing, nothing but an empty word. And what is the true object of fame, that I should speak? But fame itself, as such, is nothing: nothing but a word. For by fame, I should never think that I was a man: nothing that I should be worthy of worship, nothing that I should be worthy of respect, nothing that I should be worthy of praise, but a man as any other. For so, when thou dost think that that man was worthy of praise, whose eye was open, whose tongue was loose, or whose lips were set so. For by these things is a man worthy of praise: nothing else. (Hab. 1:12)
But when a man is worthy of praise, he is not worthy of fame. For fame is that which doth not merit any praise, which is that which is neither good, nor evil. Neither is it that which doth merit any praise, that is, if a man doth think that a man is worthy of praise, if he be a man worthy of praise. For the praise of a man, that is not worthy of it, is vain. For what is it, <END>

T is a very comfortable and pleasant thing, when a man is at peace and at ease, that he doth enjoy his senses and faculties in all their vigour and force; and that, being in a state of tranquility and quietness, he doth carry his understanding and memory with him, in all his actions, and in all his thoughts: For in a man that is at peace, we may not be mistaken, there is a true and happy state, where he doth enjoy and partake of that which is best and most excellent, both of body and soul. But a man is not at peace, if he be troubled and vexed in his mind, if he be troubled and vexed in his heart, if he be troubled and vexed in his body; For if any man be troubled and vexed in the mind, he will never be at peace, but be always in trouble and vexation; and if he be troubled and vexed in the heart, he will not be able to live a long life; and if he be troubled and vexed in the body, he <END>

Some do say, that the nature of time, is the same thing with the nature of eternity; for as eternity, doth not have any beginning or end, neither can it be measured or expressed in terms of any other things. For all the words and names we put to eternity, do but express only the idea of something infinite and endless, or unmeasurable and incomprehensible. But if, in speaking of eternity, we do use some of the names of finite things, such as hours, days, years, etc. it is not that the names themselves are infinite or unmeasurable; but that they are so applied, that they do express the true nature of those things, and that those things themselves do have the name or title, of the infinite or endless, in them.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence.
St. Augustine.
A woman, being taken with a passion, that she did not know herself, had in her hand a vessel of water, and, by her passion, did throw it out, so that all the water did run away. Now the woman, after this, did remember herself, and, being grieved for the loss of the water, she was in a great fear and dismay; for she said unto herself, That she could not get water again; but that the world would be dry, if she were not careful. She had been carried away with a passion, and by the same passion had lost that, which she could not get again; and so, she had been carried away again by the same passion, and had lost that, which she could not get again; and so it was with all her days. This parable, that women were carried away with their passions, and so they lost those things, which they could not get again, and could not recover them again. This parable is true, and it is a true parable, that there is a certain kind of madness, which is as hard to be cured, as a true madness of the mind; for she is carried away, and can carry away nothing.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain, suffering and difficulty as a way of spiritual growth.
One of the main characteristics of the true disciple is his endurance of pain and difficulty. The mind that can endure pain and difficulty, is a mind that can endure anything. As all suffering is of its kind, to be patient in the midst of pain, is the most true kind of patience, and most noble virtue. For by suffering, as a kind of death to the flesh, it is taken away, and a true life is put into it; for this is true suffering, that we may not have a true and living body, but that we may be only a mere shell and husk of a body. But if any one can bear the pain, and suffer with patience, he will be a true and living soul, and a spirit that lives upon. And this, that all the gods and the divine spirits, can suffer, and bear the pain of suffering, is the greatest thing in the world, that we can understand. For in all things, there is a natural principle, that is, a natural order, and that is the true nature and power of every thing.

As to their natural inclination; but so, that there were but a few things, and but a short time in the whole world; and that to make a good beginning, and to do well in all things, thou shouldst use that thou hast, as speedily as thou canst. The time of thy life is short, the time of the world is short; and thou that now dost live and do, it is but a short time. The world is so short; that in so short a time, it is impossible, that one man should live, or that one man should die. But what, it is the same with all men that have ever lived. The shortness of time, doth make any one thing. To make any one thing, is not that which any man of common sense, should be at all afraid of. It is not the being afraid of anything, that any man of common sense, should be at all afraid of: but to do nothing. The thing, is, what ought any man of common sense, to be afraid of.

For if thou speakest of it, thou wilt only exasperate it more: and if thou forbear, it shall by and bye lose its bitterness. (Cato)

To be angry with a man, is not to hate him, but to hate his anger: and it is reasonable for a man to hate his anger, and to make himself reasonable.

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe
For a true understanding of any one thing, it is necessary that we should know the nature of all others. For that which is true of one part of the universe, must also be true of some other part of the same universe, that it may be either the same thing or different from it. That is, the difference must be some such thing, either a proper accident of it, or a proper form of it. That is to say, if a particular man should say that his body was not a body, his body was a body, but that a body was not his body; and so forth. That is to say, if a man should say that he had no head; a head he hath; but a head he had not, that he had a head. To have a head, and not a head, are two different things: as to have a head, and not a head, is one; and to have a head, and to have a head, is another. And if one should say that a man had a head, and yet that head was not his own, he would speak falsely. That is to say, the head is not that of that man; but that of a man of the race or gender of that man: <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death? and how to prepare yourself for death?
The great philosopher Epictetus says, “It is necessary not only to fear death, but also to hate and detest it.” Death is but a natural change, and a change from one state of things to another: it is necessary therefore to hate and detest death; because it is a change of a very different kind from that of the seasons or the year. The year cometh, the year goeth: but death, which cometh not, but doth never go, is a very different change from that of the year.
It is a common error, to think that it is hard to bear death; whereas in truth it is but a change of things: and the harder the thing, the more willing is nature to bear it. But the cause that the nature of man is so well adapted for it, that death is the very end of a life naturally lived, is that man is capable of being prepared for it. And this preparation is to be made in the understanding and imagination.
How is the understanding prepared for death? For the understanding is prepared for death, by having the memory of the death of other men, and the knowledge of the nature and the cause of death. For this doth prepare <END>

I know that there must be a divine fire in some of men, which doth not only stir and animate the minds of others, but doth also inspire them with some greater purpose than the mere maintenance of their own bodies, and the satisfaction of their private desires, or appetites. This fire is no less divine, but rather the more divine, the more it doth inspire and animate men with a true sense of their own dignity and nobleness. For it is a sign that men are worthy and deserving of such a high and divine spirit, that they can conceive and attain unto those high and noble ends and purposes, which are the very perfection and crown of the universe. For to those men and those things which do deserve the highest honour and praise, it is fitting and proper to attribute and ascribe all honour and glory.

By way of argument: First, of those that do practice the art of rhetoric, how much more excellent is it that it is joined unto philosophy.

And so the two may be well joined together: For they do agree in that which is essential unto both, that is, the true understanding. And they that do understand themselves properly, doth agree and concur in all their doings, that is, in all their operations; as also in all their thoughts, that is, in all their cogitations, and considerations. But of those that doth not understand themselves, or that doth not know their own true nature, how much more excellent is it that it be joined unto the knowledge of those things that are truly and essentially different from each other, and from their own nature. And this doth necessarily follow, as a matter of fact, that it is better, that they be joined unto the true knowledge, than unto the false.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
Fame can be a curse in disguise. It is often associated with wealth and power, but it is not always the case. For instance, many famous people struggle financially, and their wealth is often used for selfish and unethical purposes.
Fame can also lead to a kind of psychological imbalance. It can make people feel like they are invincible and above criticism. They can become arrogant, and their behavior can become erratic. This can lead to a kind of isolation, where they are unable to relate to others, and their relationships with others suffer.
In addition, fame can be a source of anxiety. The pressure to constantly produce and perform is great. There is a lot of stress involved in maintaining a public image. The fear of losing fame and status is a powerful motivator. This anxiety can lead to burnout and depression.
Fame can also lead to a kind of disconnection from reality. It can make people feel like they are above the law and that they can do whatever they want without consequences. This can lead to a kind of moral decay.
Finally, fame can also lead to a kind of superficiality. It can make people focus on external appearances, and forget about the inner qualities that truly matter. They can lose sight of what is truly important, <END>

It is not an easy matter to find peace and contentment, but I do most fervently pray and implore you, as for my own sake, so for theirs, to labour after these things, that it may be the case, as a general observation, that they be able to find some satisfaction in all circumstances. But when it comes to particular circumstances, that may be able to vex and trouble us, that we may be able to bear them with patience and peace of mind, that may be said, that we have truly found our peace. That which is in this world, that is able to trouble and vex us, is but a thing that is subject to our own will; and what we do, we must not suffer that thing to trouble us, but must strive against it.

That he doth love his body, is a matter of fact.
Forsooth, a man that doth love his body, doth love himself; and he doth love himself, who doth not love himself: and he doth not love himself, that doth not love himself.
Of these few things, that he doth love his life, is a matter of opinion.
For some doth think, that life is a thing of no account. And some, that it is a thing most excellent. But the opinion of one is no more, than the opinion of another.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain is not always necessary or proper.
There are some particular kinds of pain, wherein the strength and endurance of the constitution is strained and tried. Some, for example, which arise from a great bodily change or alteration, such as the pain of the puerperal woman, or the pain of the woman who has given birth of a monster. Others, from some hurt or injury, such as the pain of a severe wound, or the pain of some disease, or the pain of the tooth. But these pains, though painful, are proper, and not dangerous to life. But some other kinds of pain, though not proper, and dangerous to life, yet are to be borne and endured. The pain of a murderer's sword, for example; or the pain of a robber's dagger, or the pain of a wild beast's sting. These pains are dangerous to life; and a man ought not to endure them. For if he can help it, he ought not to suffer any thing. For the very idea of endurance, is nothing more, than that some one thing must suffer. If he cannot help it, then he must endure, but not for the sake of enduring; for then it is a thing most improper. It is a thing proper and just, <END>

It is the greatest part of the world that is in a state of perpetual change: it is the greatest part of the world that is in a state of perpetual motion: and it is the greatest part of the world that is in a state of perpetual motion, because there is nothing that is not constantly subject to the operation of some agent. This is the general property of all things that exist. Things are all subject to operation, or rather they are all subject to operation of some kind, in some way, or by some means.
They that are of a philosophical temper, and who are well conversant with themselves, and with those that are with them, cannot but be sensible, that the universe is very short and very narrow: it is very narrow and short, in respect of the space of time which it occupyeth; and it is short and narrow in respect of the extent and bulk of things that are in it. And therefore those that are of a philosophical temper, and who are well conversant with themselves, and with those that are with them, can only wish and pray for the better part of the world, and for the better part of themselves, and for the better part of that which is with them.

For the same reason that a man, who has not learned his letters, and can speak well, is of better judgment than an illiterate man; for so, it may be, that though we have not learned our letters, and can do little, yet can we speak, and think, better than some.

To the rest of the multitude, he doth recommend to seek the truth; not for that they are ignorant, or incapable of knowing it; but for that they are so negligent and slovenly, in seeking it, that they never can attain it, without some pains and difficulties. For though men are generally slovenly and careless, yet it is not without reason; for if any one do seek after truth, it is a thing both hard and dangerous.

If any one would give the means, whereby a woman, either a matron or a maid, may find herself, and her spirit, at peace; let him do it.

There is not so much to be desired as to be happy, and to be at peace. This is the end of all desires; this is the end of all affections; this is the end of all worldly cares and troubles: This is that which is not a thing to be desired, or to be affected by, but to be embraced. To embrace and to love, that is true happiness. For if a man love the truth, and the right understanding, and be at peace; how happy must he be? How happy must the man be, that hath the truth in his hand, and in his understanding: And how happy shall the man be, that is truly happy and at peace.

Natural time is a relative concept that has undergone many transformations and changes throughout the ages. The earliest chronicles and records of time keepers date back to the Babylonians, who around 2000 BC were the first to divide the year into 12 months. The Egyptians were the first to divide the year into 365 days, and the Babylonians were the first to divide the year into 360 days.
In the Babylonian calendar, the year was divided into 12 months, with the first month, Nisanu, being the beginning of the new year. The Babylonians also had a system of counting days, which was based on the number of the moon's phases. Each month was associated with a particular animal, a particular element, and a particular color.
The Babylonians also divided the year into 12 different parts, each of which had its own name. These parts were based on the lunar cycles, with the first part beginning on the 1st of Nisanu, the first of the new year, and ending on the 29th of Tammuz, the 10th month of the Babylonian calendar. The parts were named after the animals that were associated with each of them, such as the first part, which <END>

For if they be blessed, it is by their own merit. But if not blessed, it is by their own fault. And in no case is their merit or fault either one of those things. But when they would speak, they either say or think that which they are not able to say or to think. Or they say or think that which is not good.
But that which is good, is that which is done, by the power and grace of God. For this reason is it, that the silent ones are blessed withal.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain and suffering
Endurance of pain and suffering is an aspect of the Christian life and one of the ways in which Christians live in obedience to the Gospel. St. Paul and other writers of the New Testament speak of it, as also the Church Fathers, and the blessed Martyrs. It is not less pertinent unto Christians, even to this present day, forasmuch as that, as it were, the natural temper of man is such, that it is easy for men, especially those of a seditious disposition, to take flight from their duty, and to flout against the discipline and obedience required of them. The only end of endurance of pain and suffering, is to get a share in that eternal and happy life of the saints. It is not, to suffer patiently for their own sake, but because the pain and suffering, doth but serve for the reward. If this be not so, it will follow that the suffering and pain is for itself, and is not but a means unto the end. But this, the nature of a saint is, that they suffer and do patiently endure. For the same reason, the Saints, in the times of the persecution of the Roman emperors, suffered patiently, and endured for Christ's sake. It is <END>

Of all things whatsoever, death is to be thought of first; and therefore also of the rest of all things; for it is the proper end of all things whatsoever, as well of things natural and created as things natural and spiritual; and therefore it is to be considered of first; and all things else are to be considered of as coming to this end; and as all things come to this end, all things must come to this end.
Of all things whatsoever, death is the proper end; as indeed is also the proper end of the whole world; that is to be destroyed. And that is to be destroyed, that there be no more of anything. And of this, the death of a man is the proper sign; that is to be destroyed of the body of a man.

H. On the Nature of the Universe
Tis not that they are all created, only in one of them is that which is most worthy of remembrance; but to that which is created is to be ascribed the praise of the whole.

And therefore let this be observed; that if we regard not any other, but only the nature of the Universe, there is a whole universe, that is to say, the whole World; in which every particular thing, or creature, hath a nature and essence.

Hence it followeth, that those things are as it were to be considered, which are called things; and what they are, and what they be, and what they are for; but all things in the whole Universe, and all things in all things, are to be considered together.

<BEGIN> How to face death
When we say that man's life is long and easy to live, we mean that it is short compared with the duration of the universe. But when we say that a man's death is easy to die, we mean that his death is a matter of little or no importance, because it is not much matter whether a man die early or late. In order to get rid of all fear of death, we must put the soul and spirit in a wayward and vain conceit and imagination, that it is not really a man that dies, but only a body. For of all the things that happen, death is the only thing that is truly terrible; and it is that of itself which is dreadful, not because of what it brings to pass, but because of the fear of it; for it is of that fear that the soul and spirit must be freed.

For that which makes death a fearful thing is the expectation of another life. But the soul that is freed from this expectation, that fears nothing, nor is afraid of anything, will find that she is not afraid of death.

If death be truly a fearful thing, it is because the soul must be freed from that fear of death that is the same with the fear of God. But if the soul be <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader, in any capacity, is to see that justice is done. In other words, the leader’s duty is to see that the law, or that moral system which is considered universal, is observed and obeyed. Now, such a system, I believe, does not exist; for I have never heard of any such thing as a universal moral system, which is universally acknowledged and obeyed, both by all nations, and by all men. But then, says one, what is the moral system that you speak of? For so many nations, and so many different nations, there are so many different moral systems and religious systems; and there are so many contradictions and inconsistencies, that it is impossible for any such universal moral system to exist.

To this, I answer, that it is possible. For I believe that there are certain principles and maxims, that are so generally agreed upon by all rational men, that they must be considered universal. Such principles and maxims are, the principles of justice, of morality, of truth, and of religion.

The reason why I speak of justice, is that justice is the foundation of all other moral virtues. The reason why I speak of morality, is that morality is the foundation of all other moral virtues. The reason why I <END>

Dedication to the Reader

Hath the writer of this discourse any other object or design, other than the pure and true explication of the matter in hand, as hath been already done? No; but only to help the mind and imagination to exercise and improve itself upon the matter, that is, the art of reasoning; for which there is a certain and proper kind of learning, and skill, and habit, whereby a man may be enabled to deal with reason and argument, as with any other art or skill. And as it is with any other art, so also with this: so soon as a man hath learned the matter, and the form of it, he must exercise it in practice, if he would be any way wise.

Dedication to the Reader

If the reader of these books, were of that modest and humble sort, that doth desire to be in good order, and in the right way with himself, and with others, then I pray that he may be so good and modest, as not to suppose that the art of reasoning is any thing strange or new; but to be as sensible, as is necessary, and reasonable.

For all things in the universe are in mutual relation one with another, as that which is not in a particular relation, is not of that particular kind. In the things, therefore, which are not ignorant, they are also ignorant of what is in mutual relation one with another, or of that particular relation which they are of, to some thing else. And what is it of that other thing, that they are ignorant of? Is it not of their own nature?

Fame is a fleeting thing, a thing of the air, which doth soon vanish and pass away, leaving nothing in its stead but memory, which doth in time decay. It doth depend entirely upon the good opinion of others, which is subject to all sorts of changes, and is not fixed.

This is the way with all things, which are subject to change and decay. A thing that is now of great importance, and is highly valued, is soon forgotten. A thing which is now of small importance, and is highly valued, soon ceases to be.

Fame, as I said, doth depend entirely upon the good opinion of others, which is subject to all sorts of changes, and is not fixed. A man that hath no other aim or desire, but to be loved, and to be admired, and to be envied, shall be most unhappy. For he shall never be able to satisfy himself. A man that is contented and at ease, and is not troubled with any cares or anxieties, shall be most happy.

And then let us consider, what it is that we, who live in a city, ought to do to preserve our own peace and quiet, and to preserve our own happiness.

That all things which happen, are good and just; that whatsoever is good and just, must also be according to reason; and that whatsoever is according to reason, must also be according to the law; that this law also, is according to reason and nature; that there is no reason, but the natural reason, that is to be sought, and that it is to be sought in the laws and customs, and the nature and constitution of the things themselves; that all things which are naturally good and just, are according to reason; that the reason which is according to nature, and is sought by way of laws and customs, is the true reason; and that whatsoever is against nature, and contrary to the laws and customs, is contrary to reason also. Of the whole of things, therefore, it must be understood, that the true reason is, the natural and eternal reason, which is according to the law of nature, and that it must always be sought, and used according to the law of nature.

<BEGIN> On the behavior of others. Let us be careful, therefore, how we speak of them; lest, instead of being charitable and gentle, our speech should become sour and unkind. The commonest way of speaking of others is, either in the manner of praise or censure, or of admiration or reproach. To praise or commend them, is to pass over the more excellent things in their nature, and to fix our regard on the lesser, or, at least, the more visible things. And to censure or condemn them, is either to set forth what is false and contrary unto the truth, or, to be of a partiality and favour towards the good part of mankind, and the better sort; that they, being more worthy of our good will, may be the objects of our commendation. But to commend or praise, or to censure or condemn, is not that which we should do, if our desire was to speak of others with charity, kindness, and gentleness. For this, we must consider and examine the particular character of every man; and, according to his nature and quality, must speak in such a manner, that the object of our commendation, be such as is most worthy of it, and the object of our censure, such as <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
By: J.M. Barrie
The question, why fame is meaningless, is one that is asked by many who, as they go about their daily business, have been impressed with a certain sense of the importance of that thing. They are in doubt what is the meaning of this thing. What is it that we call fame? Is it the fame of some great action, that is now past? Or the fame of some great discovery, that is now made? Or the fame of some great religion, that is now believed? Or is it the fame of some great prince, that is now in power? And if these, are the things of which fame consists, why does the fame of some great action, some discovery, some religion, or some prince, never last long? Why does the fame of these things, never last? If the fame of some action, be only for a very little while, it must be that the action is not of a lasting kind. And so, the fame of all other things is of the same kind. But how many of them are of a lasting kind? And what are these that are of a lasting kind, if it be not the fame of some action, that is now past? And if not the fame of <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace of mind: A meditation.
Meditation is a more powerful remedy than any other against those evils that afflict us; and more effectual than any other, in respect of its being of a more easy and simple kind.

For as for all those things that either by themselves or by their association, are able to cause us to be vexed and disturbed, they all are nothing, and as nothing, they are soon forgotten: for when we have once thought on them, and laid them to heart, we shall presently be free from them.

And this also we may reasonably say, that the very thing that causes trouble, is that very thing, which, if properly considered and examined, can cause no trouble; and that, if once it be considered, and set to right, all other things can be put in good order.

For what is it that troubles us? What is it that offends? Is it not pride, ambition, avarice, revenge, anger, or some other such passion? Which of these, I pray, let us once and for all consider and examine, and put them to right, that all the rest of the things in the world, may be put in good order.

How is it that pride, ambition, avarice, <END>

As the sun moves among the stars, as a wheel turning among the wheels, the stars are seen to change their order: and of them, some appear to be nearer or farther than they were; and their brightness or darkness is altered: which if the heavens had been fixed, would not have been. But because they are not fixed, it is proper, that they should have the place and the order, according to the time of the year, or according to the time of day; and so also of the planets and of the stars that are in the firmament. And it is proper that they should move among themselves in such a manner, that their motion, according to their place and order, according to the time, doth not appear as it did the day before, or the day before that. For if they should always remain in the same place, it would be as if the world was immovable; which is not so; but rather that it is a machine, which moves and is moved, according as it is disposed, by God, for His own proper ends and purposes.
The earth does also move and is moved. She doth move among herself, according to the time of the year, as also the earth of the moon and the sun <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is of the very first importance. It is the sign of a well-bred man, that he is not oft speaking: for that he is not often speaking, is the sign of a wise man. And again, he that is oft speaking, is either ignorant, or void of all wisdom, or one that is a mere buffoon. A good man is one that is not often speaking, nor yet is he silent, and unfruitful and inactive; he is one that doth speak, as a wise man, as a prudent man. And of these two kinds are the most; who do not speak as many words as they would need, but do speak as many words as they would be worthy of. For a man is worthy of what he doth speak. If therefore he doth speak many words, and they be few in weight, he is a great talker, and not a great doer; and the contrary is true. For a man's speech is not of his own making, but of God's. And as for his action, it is of the same kind; because he doth that which is of his own nature. Now it is true, that every man is able and willing to do that which is good, but none <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain
The Stoics called endurance of pain an exercise of virtue; and they showed themselves by this action worthy of praise, and deserving of all admiration. It was a true exercise of a good spirit; and those that practiced it, did manifestly prove themselves men of sound judgment, and men that were capable of the true exercise of reason, and of the true exercise of the virtues.
How to describe such endurance and constancy, as that it did not in the least abate, even when the very soul, that bore the pain, was rent and torn asunder, both body and soul? What language could we use, that might be sufficient to describe such an act of endurance? What words or expressions, what phrases or sentences, that might be adequate to express such an act? Is not it that very act of endurance, that is truly worthy of admiration, and deserving of all praise? Is it not that very act, which we call endurance of pain? Let us therefore praise it, and say that it is a truly excellent exercise of virtue, and that it is a most noble and excellent action; that it is a thing truly worthy of our admiration; that it is a true and proper exercise of a good spirit. 1

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe, a philosophical question
This work is not a work of fiction. As an excerpt from an early Stoic dialogue, it is the original source of the phrase: "Nature is a hard mistress." It is also the earliest known example of the universe as the totality of all that is. Thus the universe is not only a part of nature, but it also is the totality of nature. As such, it is the very essence of nature. If the universe is a hard mistress, that is to say, it is not kind towards her who will not submit to her laws and principles, and will not accept her grace, or her assistance.... By the universal nature, that is, by the nature which is common to all things. But also of the natural reason, which is the nature of reason itself. And so, by the nature of nature, that is, by nature itself. This is a kind of true unity. For if the universe were a unity, a one in a way of things, this would be a kind of unity, or unity of a certain sort. For a universe, or a totality of things, is a kind of unity, in this sense: that it is a certain kind of unity of a certain sort; a kind <END>

How to face death
It is very difficult to face death with courage and courage. This is not an easy thing. This is very much painful. To face death is to face the great and mighty death itself.
The wise and just men also, who have passed by, they did not suffer death, but it suffered them, and in that respect, they are most happy.
For those who are worthy of a good soul and a good disposition, they did not fear death, but on the contrary they were most bold and valiant, and with a good cheer and a happy heart, they did die. The same also was with those who were worthy of a good reputation and a good fame.
That we may have courage and fortitude, and be not afraid of death, and that we may also have a good conscience and a pure mind, and that we may always be obedient to God and his commandments, and that we may be just and temperate in all our actions, and that we may be worthy of our own dignity and of the dignity of all other men.

<BEGIN> On logic and reason
The practice of a philosopher, and a man of philosophy, doth consist in a perpetual motion and discourse. This perpetual motion and discourse is one and the same with reason; for in all these, the mind is moved by itself. The practice of a philosopher, is to understand and discourse upon nature: to see to it, that all things be well done and disposed of. The practice of a man, of the common sort, is to make the most of himself; to do that which is convenient and commodious, and to take heed of the rules of the common art. And all men do take heed of their own rules and common rules. They do therefore all one, in this; that all men do take heed of their own rules. And they all agree in this, that a man should always follow and do that, which is convenient and commodious. This is that, which is called the rule of nature.
In a word, all the things of the world are to be understood and taken in hand; but by reason only and by understanding, not by imagination or fancy.

For how many are there, among whom it is true, that when something happens, it is not as it seems, and is frequently far otherwise? It is true of the things that be done by men. For who can deny, that many things that are spoken are not true, and that many things that are done are far otherwise, than they appear to be? But it is not only true of things done by men, but also of things in themselves. For that the sun shines, that it is a sphere, and that it is hot, is not altogether what it seems. For though it be in truth a sphere, and have heat in it, that which appears to the eye, and that which is observed by the senses, is not all.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless?
Fame is often considered to be the most desirable and most coveted thing that can happen to a man. It is often said that when a man is famous, he is happy and contented. But the truth is that fame is often meaningless. The reason for this is that the object of fame, which is a man himself, is often devoid of all good qualities. And the object of his fame, which is his reputation, is a mere shadow of the true self of the man, and not a true self at all.
This is what the Buddha said in the Dhammapada. For this reason we must always remember to be mindful and cautious, and not to let ourselves be led astray by the fleeting objects of the world, and to make a distinction between the true self and the false self.
Fame is also the object of many other creatures. But they too are often devoid of good qualities. And their object of fame, their reputation, is also but a mere shadow of the true self of the man. The true self, however, is one and only, and cannot be divided.
Therefore let us always remember that true fame and honor is the one which is acquired by the practice of virtue, and the performance of good actions. Let us always <END>

This was that which the Apostle Paul calls the 'life after this life': that is, as he says, 'the life which is not in the flesh, but in the spirit'; that is, as he says, 'the life after death'.

Now the reason, why he that doth live a true and sincere life, should be able to bear the contemplation of the soul, is this: that he who doth so live, is a man, that hath in him the seed of that heavenly life, and of that eternal life, of which the Apostle Paul speaketh. He, therefore, is a true man, that doth bear the contemplation of the soul, with all that cheerfulness, that contentment, that patience, and that piety, and with all those qualities, that are necessary for such an action.

It was an ancient custom of the Romans to go to their houses every day after a certain hour in the morning, and not to return again for a long while; so as that all their business was performed within a very short time. As for the matter in hand; what soever men may have been persuaded in, either with respect to the length of their lives, or of the immortality of the soul, or of the resurrection of all souls, the truth of it all may be summed up into one simple question; which is: whether or not any man hath ever had any real happiness; or whether they have at all had anything real, which they should call their own, that which they call their happiness or contentment? For whatever they should have, whether they be happy, or be at content, that is their true and real happiness and contentment. For of that which they call their own, nothing else but a true and real happiness is; and whatever else they be happy or contented, that is but a false and imaginary happiness.

The first general maxim that may be gathered from the passage, is: Whatever man thou must do, do it with a moderate and gentle spirit; lest the things that thou must do, and the things that are done against thee, both proceed from the same source of indignation and hatred. For if anger is, as I have said, a fountain that springs up into a sea, the effect of that fountain must be felt in the whole course of nature; and in this, I have already observed, the multitude of mankind have proceeded from it. For there is nothing common amongst all men, but that they are subject unto some degree of wrath; some more, some less; but all have been, at some time or other, subject unto wrath. And this is not to be attributed to any particular men or things, but to nature itself, and the nature of the human race; as it is natural for a man to be angry, as it is natural for a man to be sad; and it is natural, as it is natural for a man to be angry, as it is natural for a man to be sad; and it is natural, as it is natural for a man to be angry, as it is natural for a man to be sad.

<BEGIN> How to face death as a Christian
To face death as a Christian is to face it as a man. To be ashamed of death is to be ashamed of a manly mind. A Christian does not fear death; but rather doth glory in it, and doth account himself blessed. For as soon as he doth die he is out of all the snares and evils that do trouble him now, and he is admitted to behold the blessed spirits, to communicate with them, and to be comforted by their company, and to have his soul delivered of all sorrow and trouble; and this he doth, out of pure faith, and a deep affection to the Saviour Christ.
Now, this is a true and faithful account of the Christian way of dying. To do good, as the apostle saith, is one thing, but to do well, as the apostle doth say, is another; and to do well, is not so easy. But what is the difference betwixt them? Is it not this? that when we do good, we do so, as to gain a good opinion and honour of men; and when we do well, we do so, as to gain the praise and honour of God? And when we do either, <END>

The virtue of a man is not the true virtue, which he doth shew in his actions and deeds, but that, which, in the nature of his soul, it doth shew: that is the true and true virtue. For virtue is the same thing that is said to be the essence of the soul; which doth of itself, and by itself, give birth and bring forth: as a spring doth bring forth and bring forth water.

Human nature is capable of anything which can happen either to the body, or the mind; for both the body and the mind are, in their own several ways, subject to many of the same accidents. The understanding, which is the more excellent of the two, being a thing which is both intellectual and natural; that is, it is both an operation of the mind, and a proper faculty of it; is subject, not only to all the accidents of the body, but even to such accidents of the mind, as affect the understanding, as a thing of itself. And though the body is subject to many accidents, which are accidental unto it, and do affect the body, or the mind; yet doth the mind, for the most part, resist and withstand them, and either changes them into something else, or makes them to happen unto the body, that they may be transformed; or else doth she herself, by her own natural power, change them, or convert them unto herself; or else doth she, for her own preservation, make use of them, and employ them, according unto the nature and proper use of them.

A true philosopher, therefore, is one that is not afraid to change, if it seemeth reasonable and just. He must take a regard unto his own conscience; and upon those things which his conscience doth commend unto him, must he therefore act, as if he had the commandment of God himself to do those very things. The question is, whether these things be of God, or whether they be not. How is this to be known, but by the commandment of God? For God, by the nature of his commandment, doth not speak unto man, that he may be able to see it. Therefore it is necessary to have a revelation from God, that one may know, whether it be of God, or not of God.

How often have men found that whatever was once performed or suffered, is now forgotten. And that it is not even worthy of a moment's reflection; how little soever it is of itself. And yet what is the reason of this? Is it that they are not able to see the happiness, peace, and contentment, that can be in the very act itself? Is it, that the memory of their sorrow or grief, is too deeply impressed upon their minds? Or that their understanding is too darkened by some cloud or prejudice; and therefore doth not clearly see, what is good and right in itself, and in other men?
Consider it therefore, O thou, who dost desire to be happy, that the very thing which thou sufferest or doest, is itself the cause of that happiness or peace, which thou desirest; and that thou canst not do any thing, without happiness; and that thou canst not do any thing, but to the best of thy power: Thou must therefore be content, that whatever thou dost do, or whatsoever thou sufferest, it shall be the best that can be done, or that can be suffered; and that thou canst not do any thing, <END>

We are to observe that the periods of the planets are not always equal. The sun is not always equal in his motions, nor are the planets always equal in theirs. For the sun is a globe, and doth therefore carry with him an unequal velocity and speed, as well in his rotation about his axis, as in his circular motion about the earth. And as the planets are also a multitude of bodies, which do move and runne with their several velocities, and in their circular motions about their axes and the earth, the times of their revolution shall not be the same in respect of their distances. The sun and the earth are the nearest and most adjoining, the other planets being more remote and separated; and therefore their times of revolution shall differ according to their distances from the sun.
And so also in the periods of the planets, for the earth and the moon, though they be nearest to one another, do carry on the motions, as if they were more remote; and their periods of revolution are not the same, as if they were not more remote.

The former is a great fault: the latter a great virtue. For silence is not the absence of the word; but of a false and idle word. And therefore, that which is spoken in the presence of one that is worthy of hearing, is not that which is said to those that are worthy of hearing only in the absence of those that are worthy of hearing.

For as he that is happy in his affairs, is happy in all the other things that are requisite to happiness, so the one that is happy in his virtue, is happy in all other things.

If it were a roaring lion, it could not, according to the true sense, of the word, be heard, because its roar could not be heard.

I can neither understand, nor can I bear, that any one should have so small a mind as to say, “We must not endure the wrath of God.” For that is no other than saying, “We must not endure anything.” For what is there that we must endure but the wrath of God? and what is the wrath of God, if it is not that which we must endure?

The wrath of God is a fire; which is a burning of all things, and a devouring of all things. And so is it with the wrath of God. It is a burning and devouring.

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe and its motion. An essay by the Rev. Dr. William Paley.

In that general sense, the universe is a great body, of which this world is one part, and of which this part is an aggregate of things, and a collection of bodies, and a mixture of all kinds of things, and a concourse of all kinds of things.

In this view, it is evident, that it is impossible, but that there is a kind of natural government over the world, or rather, a kind of natural law, that governs all things, and regulates their motions. For this is the natural consequence of all things having one common matter, and being all part of the same universe. And what is not true of other particular bodies, must also be true of this universal body; that is, it must have a natural and proper motion.

This, therefore, is the true nature of the universe; that it is a body, which is governed by some natural law or rule; and that this rule must be of that nature, which is natural and proper to the universe. For all things, whether they be particular bodies, or an universal body, must all of them be governed by that one true and universal law, that governs all things.

But the prophets and apostles have been more properly concerned about the mysteries and secrets of the divine nature; and have endeavoured, in their proper sphere, to convey unto the people those things which are necessary unto their salvation.
The multitude, how unworthy of the eternal life of God, do they not rather seek after a mere temporary life! They do desire, in the mean time, to be able to enjoy the world's pleasures; and to be able to live as they have been accustomed to live, and to be able to do as they have been accustomed to do. They desire, in the mean time, to be able to go, to travel, and to reside in the world; to enjoy their wives, their children, their estates, and their friends, as long as the time of their mortality shall last, which is but for a very short time.

Book III. Chapter II.

In the beginning, before any of all these things had been; I say, before all these things, it is true that the world was made. But that which is temporal, which is subject to change, is also subject to change, and will be changed, according as the times are. And when we speak of the time of the world, and of the duration of all things, and of the eternity of God, we must understand, that this is a matter of speculation. But the very nature of things, and that which is temporal and subject to change, that must be understood and learned by those, who seek a knowledge of those things, and the things that are subject to change.

That is, which is eternal. To say, that things temporal and subject to change are also eternal, is to say a thing which is impossible. For to be eternal is to be of one substance with God; and to be of that substance is to be that very thing which is eternal. That is, God. For this reason it is, that those things, which are of one substance <END>

If the man be of good understanding, and well skilled in the knowledge of many things; he will not only speak very little, but say little that is true; and the more he speaks, the more false he will speak. He that is very talkative is never satisfied, and so cannot rest in quietness: but the silent man is able, with great ease and speed, to give his assent or his disagreement; and without much trouble or inconvenience, to leave the matter. The silent man is able to say that which is true and false, without saying that which is false, and without saying that which is true. A man who speaks much, is either very foolish, or very wicked; but a silent man is either very wise, or very good. And such is the case of many that are silent.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain can vary widely among individuals. Factors that may influence an individual's endurance of pain include genetic predisposition, emotional and psychological factors, and environmental and social factors.
Endurance of pain can also vary widely depending on the specific type and severity of the pain. For example, a mild pain that is associated with a common and harmless condition, such as a headache caused by tension or a cold, may be endured for a longer period of time than a more severe and potentially debilitating pain, such as a severe migraine or a chronic illness. Furthermore, an individual's ability to focus attention and manage distraction, as well as their ability to maintain motivation and engage in coping behaviors, can also influence their endurance of pain. Additional factors to consider are the individual's past experiences and memories, including experiences related to pain, and their social and cultural background. Understanding these factors can help healthcare professionals to provide individualized treatment and support to individuals with chronic pain. Effective management of pain is critical to improving quality of life, reducing suffering and disability, and promoting health and well-being.
Despite the complexity of pain endurance, there are various evidence-based treatments and interventions that can help individuals to manage pain. These include pharmacological treatments, such as medications and other interventions. Behavioral interventions, such as cognitive-behavior <END>

On the shortness of life; a philosophical dialogue (1630)
On the shortness of life; a philosophical dialogue (1630) is a philosophical dialogue in the style of Montaigne written by George Sandys. It is a discourse that begins with a discussion about the shortness of life, and it then proceeds to the treatment of the nature of time and the universe. The work is dedicated to the Earl of Worcester.

The work begins by pointing out that time is a finite quantity that is always passing, and it is finite. It then discusses the nature of the universe, which is made up of two kinds of things: bodies and voids. The first kind of bodies are those that can be touched and seen, and the second kind of bodies are those that cannot be seen. The work also discusses the nature of the universe and the order of the universe.

The work also discusses the nature of the soul and the mind. It points out that the soul and the mind are not separate things, but are one and the same. It discusses the nature of the soul and the mind, and how they are related to one another.

Death is one of the most dreaded and feared phenomena of human existence. The fear of death is natural, and its inevitability is inescapable. The question, however, that we need to answer is: how to face death?
The first step, which is not difficult, is to accept death. We should realize that death is natural and inevitable and that our life is but a fleeting moment. The fear of death must be removed and we should realize that our fear is based on a false assumption.
We must not be afraid of death and yet not be indifferent. We must be prepared to meet death and yet we must not be hardened and unmoved. We must be like a man who is not afraid of the darkness, yet does not want to be in it; and is not afraid of the cold, yet does not want to be frozen. We must be like a man who is not afraid of the pain of death, yet does not want to die in pain.

A leader, that is, should be the very opposite of a tyrant or an oppressor: and as long as he is truly a leader, it is his duty to set an example of good and virtuous behaviour to those under his conduct; that he may teach and instruct them, both to respect themselves and one another. The very foundation and support of a good government, is the good disposition and will, and the right disposition of a good ruler and leader.
That which is necessary, but not sufficient, to secure the common-wealth, is that the ruler should not only be good, but wise; that is, that he should have a right understanding of what is necessary, for the support of a good government: and that he should be able to foresee all the particular difficulties and difficulties that may happen, and to be able to do his part in the way of preventing them; and also of doing, with all due haste, such things as shall be necessary <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death and its inevitability? To answer this question, we must consider how death relates to human experience. We must explore how human beings are affected by the thought of death. How do we reconcile with death? And how do we seek to make sense of our own mortality in life?
First, let's look at the role of death in the human experience. Death is a fundamental reality that is common to all living beings. Death is the natural and inevitable end of all living things. Death is a universal theme and is often used as a symbol for something that is irreversible. Death is often used in poetry, literature, and art to represent something that is impossible to undo or change. Death is used to express the finality and irreversibility of certain actions. Death is often associated with the unknown, the unconsciousness, and the finality of a person's life. Death is often used to express fear and anxiety about something that is outside of our control. Death is also associated with loss and bereavement. Death is often used to express a sense of loss and grief. Death is often used to express a sense of finality and irreversibility.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
The value of fame is usually measured by its ability to attract attention, and by the importance that people place on it. Yet fame, as a thing in itself, is neither desirable nor hateful. If it is desirable, it is only because we want to be admired and praised. And if it is hateful, it is only because we do not wish to be admired and praised. We must not be deceived by the consideration of the good and bad reputation of some persons. It is enough for a man, if he be able to bear his reputation, if that be the case of others. It is not the opinion of the multitude that should give him a right to be esteemed and respected. For he that is esteemed and respected, ought to be esteemed and respected not for the opinion of the multitude, but for some good and worthy deed. Or rather it ought to be done out of a sense of duty and justice. But that which is most worthy and justifiable in the world is that which is done out of a sense of duty and justice. And that which is done without such a sense is neither worthy nor justifiable. This is the only rule, and the true rule, both of our moral conduct, and of our natural behaviour, and of that which is generally <END>

To love is to will the good of the beloved, and in this sense to will his happiness.
To say or do anything against the good of the world, and to do anything against the good of a man, is either to be an enemy of God, or an enemy of God and a friend to evil. The happiness of the world is a happiness of reason, or a happiness that is according to reason. To do anything against the good of reason, and the good of the world, is a kind of madness. Every man is to be good, that he may be happy: and every good man is happy, that he is good.
That is a thing which is proper to virtue, which is not common to other things, that the good man doth love the good. Love is a sweet and amiable thing, it doth bear its own seed; it doth bring forth itself; it doth multiply itself, and is a perpetual seed. Wherefore the good man must always love the good, because it is the fruit and the seed of the virtues. The virtues are the seeds of the virtues.

<BEGIN> On the passage of time, the mind is never more disturbed and irritated, than when it is once more struck with a sense of its own mortality. Every man, in the fullness of his years, and in the maturity of his age, should be able to look back upon his life, and to reflect upon the particular events that have occurred, as they were the necessary means to bring him to the point whereof he now is: as they are also to be the necessary means of bringing him to that point, which is as it were the next, and not very far from it. Thus the mind is, or should be, well able to find the cause of all things that happen. Or rather, I should say, it is, and ought to be, able to find the necessary means and subsidence of all things, that is to say, that of all things. For if thou sayest that all things, which do happen in this world, do happen for some particular and sufficient cause: then shall not that be, which thou sayest that is the principal, or common cause, of all things. For this also, that doth happen in this world, is caused by some particular cause: and so on ad infinitum. But what is it that doth cause the <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence
In this treatise, one can see the entire system of philosophy and religion, and all the rules and customs of the world, reduced to a single and simple truth; which is, that a man ought not to speak anything against another man, but what he himself is himself acquainted with, and that he ought not to speak, but that which he himself can be sure of, and not speak of anything, but that which is good, just, and fair. And that in general, a man ought to be silent and quiet, as the angels and the blessed spirits, and as the very universe itself. (From the Greek text.)

In the Latin translation of the Proverbs, it is written, "He that is silent, is as an angel." From the Greek, as the Psalmist saith, "They that go down into Sheol, never do speak again." (Ps. 120.) In the Psalm of the man who was blind from his mother's womb, it is written, "Silence is as the soul, and speech is the flesh." (Ps. 119.) It is also written, "The mouth of the righteous is as an instrument of praise, and his tongue is as a sharp sword." (Ps. 128, <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain or discomfort: a thing of which no one is able to bear; a burden that no man can endure.

Endure; bear. Enduring, endurable.

Example sentences:

* No one could bear the pain and suffering of those who were afflicted with disease.
* She could endure the hard work and the long hours of study, but her sister could not.
* The ship endured the fury of the storm, but the passengers were thrown into a state of panic.
* No one could endure the agony of losing her loved one.
Synonyms: suffer, bear, bear with, put up with.

Antonyms: resist, endure no longer; bear no more.

Origin: This is one of Chaucer's favourite phrases, and it has been used by many other writers, poets and even politicians throughout the centuries. It is thought to have been coined in the early 14th century; from this it would mean 'a thing of which one could endure nothing'; that is to say, a thing which would be too much to bear; a thing which no man could endure.

This first proposition, concerning the shortness of life, I have already mentioned. I have also made use of the second, which I now do expound. For there are two sorts of time. The time that is out of mind, I have already said, is that which is past. This, I say, is that time, which doth never cease from being past, as long as any man liveth. For as long as any man doth live, so long will time of all sorts continue. But of those things which are past, none of them will any more continue, as long as this present time will last; and so on for all time.
For so also that time is divided, as I before have said, into past, present, and future. That is to say, time of the past, that is to say, past time; that is to say, the time which is now past: that is to say, present time; that is to say, the time which shall now after be: that <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger
This is one of the few cases in which the Stoics are more tolerant and lenient. They are not willing to suffer that any man should be severely censured or punished for a thing, whereof he has no actual guilt. But yet is this not to be understood as any encouragement for men to do evil. For this is a part of that which is good: that such things are to be done, or omitted. But that which is evil is such things as are done, or omitted. So that by all means, that may be avoided, it is good. But that which is not to be done, or omitted, it is evil. Now, this is the proper object of the Stoic philosophy.
The first question is, what is anger, and of what kind? For those who do not know what it is, to understand it, it is not possible for them to know what it is to be angry at, and what it is to be angry with. For, as we have already said, that anger is of two kinds; that of the passion, and that of the mind. First, as it is of the passion; that which is proper to the passion; and which, if it do happen, it is anger. Secondly <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death?
Facing death is not about fear of dying but about facing death head-on. It involves a willingness to let go and a acceptance of the inevitable. The Bible teaches that all men must die, and that the natural man has no regard to die (Ecclesiastes 8:13; Luke 1:51). Therefore, the question is not how to avoid death, but how to meet it with courage, contentment, and confidence. There are certain principles that are to be followed in order to meet death in a proper manner. These principles are to be followed in order to make one’s dying easy and comfortable.
How to be prepared to die?
All men must die. But, if we can but meet death with patience and courage, it must be a blessing. Then first and foremost, it is necessary, for men to be prepared. Herein, I speak not of the readiness of men to die. This, indeed, is not always the case; but that they may, at their death, meet with those things that are necessary for their comfort and peace. Then let the man be prepared for the judgment of God, for his resurrection, and for his eternal residence in the place appointed for him. Let the man be prepared for the departure of his <END>

It is a small part of that one, which is properly called a demonstration; and that again is part of a greater, that is properly called an argument, or proof.
In logic and rhetoric, there are three parts of speech: the simple, the compound, and the complex. Of these, the first is one simple sound, or sound alone; the second is one sound of two, and of two different things; and the third is one of three, and of three different things.
The simple sound is one of one single thing. The compound sound is of one thing, and another: as two or more. The complex sound is of one thing, and two or three other things.
These three sounds, therefore, are all of one substance, and of the same kind; but are, in respect of the number of things, different.

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless.  By Sir Arthur Waley
Sir Arthur Waley (1888-1962), a British sinologist, historian and writer, was also known as Arthur John Waley. He translated many classic Chinese texts into English. Here are the reasons why fame is meaningless, as per Sir Arthur Waley’s opinion.
Fame is a thing that is most troublesome and hurtful in its effect, and a very bitter poison. It is as if a man should take a sharp knife in hand to cut himself, and to make a wound in himself, which would be a very foolish and silly action.
Fame, or the desire to be famous, is a very great temptation, but a very small profit. For when men are in a state of fame and reputation, it is but a thin disguise for their ignorance and impotence.
In general, fame is a thing that is most desirable to those that are ignorant, and most despised by those that are wise and knowledgeable. For how can they know what is fame, or what is a thing worthy of fame, but those that are ignorant and foolish, or those that are wise and knowledgeable, respectively.

By my self, I found some peace and quietness. To the end I shall ever remember, the many things that my father did. As one who had been long dead; I did at the last learn, the truth of that saying, That those things that are true, are those that are eternal; and that those things that are false, are those that are temporary.
Then did I also consider, how that which was temporary and fleeting, could not be but changeable. For they that were once happy and blessed, are now no more happy. And they that were once unfortunate and miserable, are now no more miserable; and yet they change from one to another. For that which is temporary, must also be mutable: as it is written, "For all things must pass, as the grasshopper, and the wild things of the field, and the reed, and the papyrus, and the other things, that grow and flourish, and that change, and that pass, and that are transitory." — Ezechiel, 13: 22.

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is often misunderstood by people. In some cases, a silent person may seem aloof, distant, and uncommunicative. But in many cases, the silent person is a person of deep thoughts and profound reflection, who may not choose to express his feelings and sentiments either on account of delicacy, modesty, or reserve. The silent and reserved nature of some, may sometimes give a false appearance of pride or haughtiness; but in truth, they are the very opposites of pride or haughtiness; for they are of a meek and gentle disposition, who are not ambitious, nor vain, nor proud. The virtue of silence is very much to be admired, especially in those that have been brought up with the education of a court; and to be silent and reserved, in a court, is much more honourable, than to be loud and talkative. To be silent and reserved, in the midst of a crowd, is a great virtue and a great honour. The silent and reserved, in a crowd, is as a shield and a buckler. For when men are silent and reserved, they are like men standing in the front of the army, or men who are set to watch, and to defend themselves against the enemy. For those that <END>

To him who hath a true mind, and is of one mind with the Father and Son, it is easy to endure, as well as to do good; and it is natural to him. To him that is not of one mind with the Father and Son, and is not able to endure the sufferings and the pains of this life, it is not easy, neither natural: because as soon as he doth strive to endure any thing, it is either as it were the death of him; or as it were the destruction of his soul: or both.

This is the very truth and simplicity of the matter: and I say, that whosoever doth suffer, and endureth, is as one of the very saints: for they suffereth and endureseth, and doth good unto the world, as the saints do, and will do.

<BEGIN> On the shortness of life
How then must one regard the present life? It must be considered, as shortening or prolonging the time of one's life. And in such regard, how often is it made use of by those who are of a religious cast of mind, as also those who are in their senses? This is their argument; Thou must live a long and happy life, in order to be happy, that is, in order to be long; and not to live a short and unhappy life, in order to be unhappy, that is, in order to be short; and so to be content. Thus, the true and right use of the present life is, that it may not be cut short; or, that it may be longed for, and enjoyed, by all that are of a religious cast of mind. That is, they that would have a long life, for the sake of their religion. For to be long, is not of the nature of man; but the shortness, and the shortness of one's life, that is a common fate of all mankind. But what a happy man is, that can make use of the present life, as that it may not be cut short; but may be longed for, and enjoyed, that is <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger. I have read that certain philosophers, as the Stoics for example, and some Platonists, have spoken very largely of anger and of its nature. And truly, of this subject, we ought to have some knowledge, not only because it is a most common passion, which many men suffer themselves from, and many others provoke and stir up in others; but also, because, if we have not a good and proper way of managing our anger, it doth easily carry us away, and doth hurt and corrupt us; and is the occasion of many miseries and evils both to the man himself and to those who suffer from him. Therefore, I must insist that we have some knowledge of this matter, that we may be able to manage and control it properly, and so not to let it carry us away. The nature of anger, as the Stoic philosophers say, is to have the sting of it upon us. It is a pain of the soul; and if it doth not take some other course, it will bring us to a most miserable state of mind. The sting of anger is, that it doth make the passions which are joined with it, not only to be troublesome, but also most troublesome and vexatious. For this <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death? (The question of death)
What can one do with oneself, and with one’s soul, when the time of death approaches? This question was the object of much meditation, among the Stoics. Seneca has given a short answer to it; and he says, “Let thyself, as a rational and reasonable man, and in general as a good and virtuous man, be ready for death, and ready to give a satisfactory account of thyself. Let it not trouble thee, that thou shalt not have a place in heaven; that it is not the way of those that are of that world. Let thyself be contented; for death is nothing else, than the natural conflux of the parts of the body, to their own proper place, and separation: and it is not the way, either of the bodies, or of the soul. For what is it, but a return to the elements? what, but the conflux of the parts into the universe? What is it, but a conflux, and a change of place? and is it not that also which happeneth, in every natural motion? Let no other cause move thee, and no other cause, and no other thing, hinder thee from being contented and ready. <END>

<BEGIN> On logic and reason.
In the natural world, all things that are reasonable are found; in the world of men, those which are unreasonable. The latter, however, do not only exist, but are also very well adapted to their proper ends; and in proportion as they are unreasonable, so are their proper ends unreasonable. And when, therefore, one must choose between those two things, to use reason or to use an unreasonable thing, it is better to use reason; not only because there are those which are unreasonable, but because of the very nature and constitution of the mind, that it can never be reasonable. (c)
The only thing, however, which is unreasonable, is that which is unreasonable itself. All things which are reasonable are, in fact, reasonable, and in a certain sense they are all of them rational. And such is the very nature of reason itself, that it can never be unreasonable.
All rational things are reasonable. All unreasonable things are also unreasonable. But that which is neither reasonable nor unreasonable, cannot exist.

Thus, there is no difference, either in the thing itself or in that which is done concerning reasonable things. <END>

From this we must learn, that of a thing, which is to do by thee, thou must be able and willing. For so long as thou canst do it, and as long as thou art able to do it, it is no matter whether the thing is of a god, or of a man; only if thou canst, and wilt, it. For so is it, that a man may do what is good and just; if he doth it. But he who doth it, as he is able, doth it according to reason and right reason; but he who cannot do it, as he is able, doth it according to his own power and ability.

A long time ago, in the days when men were younger than now, I was wont to say, That all men should strive to live quietly, to do their work well, and to live in a quiet manner. For that is the true beauty, to live well. For the beauty of man is not that he may be able to do any great and noble things, but that he may be able to live well, and to live according to his own proper nature.

As I walk, I ponder upon those things, and considerations of nature and life, that I may live and move in harmony and concord with it. For this is the true meaning and end of a man's life.

in the stillness and quiet of a forest; or of a mountain.
In the stillness and quiet of a forest; or of a mountain, where the trees stand not so much in their height and bulk as in their beauty and order; the birds sing their morning hymns and sweet melodies; and the very air, it doth seem, with gentle and sweet music, to resound, and echo with sweet voices, of the blessed and heavenly host, of angels and blessed spirits; and every object and image, that is beheld, doth seem to have a spiritual and mystical meaning and signification.

<BEGIN> On the passage of time, there is a very remarkable change: and in particular, the difference of time is not so much altered in the same day, as is that which passes in one day: whereas one day is a year to another day; and another day is a century to another day. For the number of days in one year is but a part of the number of days that pass in one day. But the time of one year is as much as the time of one day, that which passeth in one year, and which passeth in one day, are two things, as different as a day and a year, or as a night and a day. The time that passeth in one year, is the time that passeth in the same day: but the times are not the things which pass in it, that are not the same. For if one time passeth in another, it is not the time, but the things that pass in it, that are not the same. Thus for this reason: that one day may pass in a whole year, that which passeth in it, that is not the same that that passeth in a day. For as the sun passeth in a whole day, and the whole day passeth in the sun: so do <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is very noble.
They have shown themselves in their writings and discourses very well able to speak a great deal. But when they speak, it is in few words: not of the multitude, but of few.
To be silent, is to speak well. (Theos)
To speak is to do good. To be silent is to do good also.
They have learned of our forefathers to be silent, who are truly wise and just. (Seneca)To speak well, is to speak but once; to speak often, is to speak but badly. (Epictetus)
And they that do speak often, are those that speak most of a lie.
There is a certain gravity and gravity of speech, whereby one's words do weigh heavily upon his mind. (Seneca)
It is not the length of the speech that maketh it good, but the manner and the matter. (Cicero)
When once a man hath begun to speak, there is no time to give him any answer; because he speaks with all haste; and his words are as those of a man that hath but one thing in his mind. (John Calvin)
To speak is to obey. To be silent is to obey also.

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain and suffering, in the hope of a better life, as it is called. What is it that the soul of a man is, that he can endure pain, and yet can still hope to be better? Is it the pain itself that can endure, or the hope itself that can endure? or is it the understanding and the memory, that can endure the pain and hope, and yet not be destroyed?

One must be able to endure pain, that is, to endure the afflictions of life, and yet not be destroyed by them. One must also be able to endure hope, and yet not be destroyed by it. For if one can endure hope, then he cannot be destroyed by it; but if he is destroyed by hope, then he cannot endure it.

There are two kinds of endurance: one that is natural and ordinary, and the other that is extraordinary and uncommon.

The first kind is natural and ordinary, because it is such as happens of itself and by nature, and is not forced or coerced by any external thing. For example, a man can endure his own pain and suffering, because it is his own, and is a part of his own constitution; but it is not the pain and suffering of the external world that he can endure.

Stoic meditation
Stoic meditation: For whatsoever is it that doth hinder, or hinder not, the continuance of any man; it is not a thing that is either done, or not done: and therefore it is not any thing that is either done, or not done. The world itself is not anything either done, or not done. And the world itself, the life of the world, and the life of a man, is all one and the same.

— Epictetus
As one saith, a man is nothing but a life, that is cut off, and cut off at certain times; a man is nothing but a life, which is but the space of a breath in the course of things.

— John Donne

A man who is a true philosopher, that is to say, he, that is of the true philosophy, must always be in a mind to live according to nature, and to live according to reason.

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger. I say that thou shouldst not let thy mind be troubled, but shouldst quietly bear with that which is amiss. For either it is some particular matter which thou shouldst attend to, or it is the natural consequences of the actions which thou hast done. In either case it is not for thee to be troubled or vexed. What thou hast to do is to be able to bear it patiently and quietly, and so to remove it. Thou oughtest to bear it, that it may not give thee occasion to do any thing rash and unworthy; but to do it, thou must take care, that it be not done with any pride, or with any pretence of power. For this thou must first of all learn, and make known unto thyself: that it is a great part of wisdom to be able to bear patiently, and quietly, any thing that may happen, without either angering or deceiving those who are about thee. What is it that thou oughtest to be ashamed of? It is, either the anger of others; or the anger and wrath of thine own heart. For this, if thou take care, thou mayest bear it patiently, without either being angry or angry with thine own heart; as thou might <END>

<BEGIN> On the nature of the universe.  This is an argument drawn from the nature of things: the first question, whether the world be finite or infinite, is this, whether the things that are, and the things that are not, be finite or infinite: for these two kinds of things only is it possible, either to speak of their nature, or to make any comparison between them; either to speak of their nature, because they are such as to admit of comparisons, or to make any comparison, because it is necessary either to speak of their nature, or else to understand of something else that is not subject to comparison.  I. To be able to make any comparison;  To be such, as to admit of any comparison:  To be finite.  II. To be such, as to admit of any comparison:  To be infinite.  III. To be such, as to admit of no comparison:  To be finite, and not infinite:  To be a circle.  IV. To be such, as to admit of no comparison:  To be infinite, and not finite.  To be a sphere.  These are the four kinds of things that only are capable of being compared:  those which are finite, and finite, or both finite and infinite. <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death?
What can we do to face death with courage? The most important thing is to accept death as it is. It is the same fate which awaits all of us. One has to face it and accept it with a calm mind. To be frightened at death and to be afraid to die is very foolishness. For there is no fear for the dead. What has he to fear, he is dead, his body is dead and life is dead. His mind is free. His life has passed off. He is in heaven, where all that is dead are. Now he is in that state, and his life is in that state, he is not in any other state. He has passed off from the world, and he is in heaven. And his mind is in heaven, where the souls of all who have passed off do now reside. He is now in that world, and now that state, and now in that body and that life which now passeth off. But a man who is afraid of death, and doth not bear his mind to be in such a state, and doth not bear his body to be in such a state, he doth bear his mind and his body in such a state, and doth not bear his life, <END>

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is to teach; to guide; and to encourage those that follow him, and who follow him. He should never use any authority or power without that authority and power are justified and warranted; as in the case of the Magistrates of ancient Rome, and the Judges in the common law; and other such as are placed in similar positions in modern times. This also is necessary, as they will often be found to need advice and counsel, in the conduct of their business, and the management of their estates, and other things pertaining thereto.
To teach, therefore, is the chief duty of a leader. But the particular manner in which they teach, is not less worthy of notice; for in this there are many things to consider. As that they should be plain and honest in their speech. As that they should use a proper and becoming manner, of addressing themselves. As that they should be careful, that they do not use any language, which can give affront and pain. As that they should be modest, and not presumptuous. As that they should be courteous. As that they should use of their own knowledge, and authority, rather than to refer themselves to the opinion of others. As that they should not be too hard on those, who are not <END>

<BEGIN> On the behavior of others. If thou wouldst find thyself in a more pleasant and comfortable place, thou must not only avoid the company of those that are proud and haughty, but also those that are too familiar and intimate, because both kinds are a hindrance to thy own self- improvement.

But how canst thou avoid the company of those that are proud and haughty, if thou dost live amongst them, and the society of such men is necessary for thee, as the society of others, for a particular purpose? There are those among whom thou must live, of whom one kind at least is necessary for thee, to supply the occasion of thy actions. If thou wilt not be a fool, thou must have some particular occasions for thy actions; and in the affairs of this world, such occasions are not to be found but in the society of particular men. And it is not possible for one man, that is to say, one single individual, to be in the society of every man that is in the world. The society of every man is either too small, or too great, to be conveniently in the society of every other.

Therefore, in order to live in society, thou must seek to find thyself amongst particular men; and particular men, amongst particular groups of men <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless. Famous people often experience existential dread. They are aware that they are not just ordinary people. This is not a bad thing. It is a good thing. They have access to great knowledge, great wisdom, and great creativity. And they have a lot of responsibility. They have a lot of influence. They can make a big difference in the world. The more they are aware of this, the more they can use their powers. And the more they can use their powers, the more they can achieve. And the more they can achieve, the more they can fulfill themselves. So why do we hate our own selves. This is the most difficult problem. We are all the same. We are all human beings. We are all the same in this regard. And yet we are all different. We have different minds. We have different experiences. We have different thoughts. We have different desires. We have different hopes. We have different fears. We have different loves. We have different hates. And we all experience them in different ways. And yet we all hating ourselves. The reason of this is. We are not satisfied with ourselves. We are never satisfied. We are never content. And that is why we hate ourselves. We do not love ourselves. We do <END>

...the only way to find peace of mind and spirit is by believing in our Lord, and to find peace of conscience, is to follow His laws and precepts...He that is in peace is he who is in a right understanding and knowledge of the truth; for only is a man in peace that is in truth, and only is a man in truth that is in right understanding, and in that only that is he in peace, who is in right understanding...the peace of God is not the peace of the world, that is, of the flesh, but the peace that is from above.

And yet it is true, that a man, that is in peace of mind and spirit, and in the peace of conscience, is that man only, who is in truth and right understanding of the things that are right, and who doth love the things that are right...for the peace of the mind and spirit is not without sorrow; and without the sorrow of the mind and spirit, can no man be in peace; for it is not the mind only, but also the body, that is in pain, and in sorrow...it is true, that a man can never be in peace, but that is he only that doth seek first the <END>

The first part of this discourse, which I have not yet spoken of, I suppose I shall not have time to consider of, for that is not a subject of such great consequence to the world; and yet so often is it spake of, and yet so rarely is it spake of. Now the other part, which is of the passage of time, and the perpetual succession of all things, is of greater concernment to any man than is any other thing that can be conceived.

But what of time, and of the perpetual succession of all things? that is a subject indeed worthy of consideration; but what is there in that, but that it is true that all things must succeed one after another, and that in their succession, there must be one that succeeds another. And is this the subject that thou speakest of? Is this the thing that thou dost in mind?

And what of the immortality of the soul? is it not also that which thou dost in mind?

Now consider what a soul is: a soul, a spirit, a creature of God, with all its parts and members, in the body that it doth inhabit. And what is that soul <END>

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence
In the world of human affairs, the most common and general practice is that of speaking and speaking out of turn: whereas it is proper to keep the mind and the tongue in silence. For who is it that ever did speak well and say something profitable, without keeping the mind in silence?

The virtues of a virtuous man; that is the main point. For of what use is the understanding, the reason, the memory, and the will, and all those things which are the instruments of the intellect, and the faculties of man, if they are not carried out and exercised by means of virtues, according as they are wont to be? The virtue of silence, I say, is one of those virtues, which are to be carried out and exercised by means of the understanding and reason; and which, in this life, are the very chief of all.

The greatest part of men, I say, are ignorant of their own ignorance, as I have said; and that there is such a thing as ignorance and error: but for that reason alone, that there may be ignorance, and error, it is necessary, that there may be ignorance, and error, of ignorance and error; or the ignorance of ignorance, and the error of error: in a word, <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain can vary widely between individuals. Some people can tolerate pain well, while others may be more sensitive.
If a person has been injured, he or she may need to take care to avoid exacerbating the injury. In this situation, some people may find that the presence of a friend or companion helps to alleviate the pain, while others may find that a friend’s presence makes the pain feel worse. Some people may also find that the physical environment of the situation—such as the temperature and lighting—can affect how much pain they can tolerate. In general, people’s experiences of pain can be influenced by their mental and emotional states as well. For example, if a person is in a depressed state or is preoccupied with negative thoughts, they may be less able to cope with pain than if they were in a more positive and resilient mental state.
Even if a person is experiencing pain, it does not necessarily follow that they will experience distress. Some people are resilient and able to cope with pain without feeling distressed, while others may experience significant distress. The capacity for emotional resilience is thought to be influenced by a range of factors, including genetics, upbringing, and life experiences. For example, people who have experienced trauma in their lives may be more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder <END>

<BEGIN> On dealing with anger: A Stoic meditation
To deal well with anger, or with any other passion, is to beget in thy mind the right judgement, and to consider, that it is a thing not of itself, but is wrought out by the confluence of other causes and circumstances. Now thou mayest readily observe, how many causes there be which concur to produce this anger. But thou shalt not consider of all those, which thou canst not know. No, thou shalt only consider of those, which thou canst know: for this is the part of a man, that is worthy and wise.
To the man who has begun to reason: let this also be his conclusion, that his anger shall not last long, and shall soon pass over unto another: and that it is not the proper seat of this anger, that doth stir it up, and make it to persist. For many things do stir it up, and yet not properly, or according to their proper nature: as in the case of the lover, and the friend, or the servant, or the master: for these things are not proper to anger, but to some other passions; but yet do stir it up.
It is then that the wise man is able to be free from anger, <END>

<BEGIN> How to face death with equanimity?
The only reason for which we should fear death is because it will cut us off from the world. But if we be but like the trees, which bear fruit, so also may we bear fruit to God in our lives. What is a man, that is a mortal man? If he can only have one hour to live, to consider how he may spend that hour, what is it that should be his greatest care? To carry himself with honour, or to carry his affairs with the greatest quietness and peace? But what is this that he should carry with the greatest quietness and peace? To do nothing but what God hath commanded. What is it to do nothing but what God hath commanded? To love God, and to obey him; but how is it to obey him? It is but to follow the examples that were set to us, and to do as he has commanded, that we may not be deceived. If it is a command of God, it is no commandment against us: what can he be but a kind father? What is this, but to do as a good son should do? What is it that is required of thee? What is this?

<BEGIN> The duty of a leader is not to follow the crowd, but to create the crowd. This means that instead of being afraid of what others will think, we should be bold enough to think differently and be willing to go against the crowd when necessary. As Mahatma Gandhi said, “If you do not believe in the cause, then it does not matter what others believe; but you must, if you truly desire that the cause should prosper and that you shall be able to make a contribution to it, believe in that cause.” Belief is not a passive receiving of facts, but rather a proactive acceptance and embracing of the truth, even when it goes against what others believe. Therefore, instead of blindly following the crowd, we should take the initiative to explore and investigate, to ask the right questions, and to challenge conventional wisdom when necessary. In other words, instead of passively accepting the status quo, we should be actively engaged in creating and shaping the future. As the great poet Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “Do not be afraid to think for yourself; that is the foundation of all greatness, of all that is good.” This is why the process of self-examination is so important, for it enables us to think for ourselves and to challenge our own beliefs and assumptions.

<BEGIN> On the behavior of others, how one must use one's own understanding: (Eust. 3). The whole world, by a great multitude of men, is filled and occupied with a multitude of actions. If thou wilt not be content, therefore, to follow some particular action, thou must consider the nature and disposition of the whole world. In what things whatsoever, doth the world consist, whether it be in matter and form, or in some other sort, thou must, therefore, always have some understanding of. But if thou wilt not use thy understanding, then is thy life nothing but a mere trifle. For so many men have lived and died in the world, and yet can live and die without using any understanding whatsoever. The world is so great, that every man's understanding, as well as his other faculties, must always be ready, and able, to understand anything which is done or to be done in it. (Eust. 4).
In what things, therefore, whatsoever, doth the world consist, thou must have an understanding of the matter; as that matter, is in itself, and of itself, and that is not anything other, but matter, and form, and those other things, which do consist in a world. As that matter, <END>

<BEGIN> Why fame is meaningless
Fame is a fleeting, transitory thing. The greatest and most glorious glory that men can attain in this life, is not glory; but a true and honest life. But, I know, many men would say, that if they were not known to all men, they would be no better men than other men. That is the height and perfection of their glory; to be known to all men, not for any virtue, but for their outward appearance and comely parts.
And yet, is it true that they are known to all men? No, no, not so much known, as some that have been but a day or two in the world. The name of the one is Timothy, the name of the other Timothy. What doth Timothy know of the other Timothy? None at all, no more than what a blind man, or a drunken man, knoweth anything of another blind man, or drunken man.
And, is it not so, that many a man, that was a good man, and a godly man, in his ordinary course, was not known to any man at all? I do not speak of the many that were known by their works, but of those that were known only by their name. What did he, <END>

<BEGIN> On finding peace and contentment, the great philosopher Epicurus said, that his pleasure was to live; that he had a great and earnest desire to be happy and contented; and that the cause of his happiness and contentment was his own good disposition, his constant meditation, and his conversation with good and virtuous men.

The cause of his happiness and contentment, then, was his own good disposition. How then can it be that many of us, who are much more contented than many of our forefathers, should complain so much of their own happiness? The cause is not their happiness, but their discontent; which comes either from their own bad disposition, or from the corrupt nature of the world. Let us, then, seek to get rid of our discontent, as soon as possible, either by improving our own disposition, or by changing our place, and removing ourselves from the corrupt influences of the world. Let us, therefore, not only be contented, but let us also be happy, and that by a sincere and hearty desire after happiness and contentment. (From the Stoic)

<BEGIN> The virtue of silence is the one that is most difficult for a man to keep. For generally men are lovers of words, and very fond of speaking, and in the practice of their speaking, they find a great delight. In all other cases, indeed, men are governed by reason and virtue, and yet they cannot do it in their speaking. For they would rather do a wrong thing, than not to speak at all, and therefore they are often in a manner undone, either by the wrongness of their words, or by the folly, or rashness, and impiety, and many other things. In the case of the Stoics, however, this is not so. For they also do speak, but they are so much bound up in the fear of God, that they do not speak at all, unless it be upon very great occasions. But even then, if it be not for the public good, they would be more disposed to keep silence, than to utter words.
The Stoics also speak of the three types of silence. The first is the silence which is observed in respect of things, which are of themselves silent, or do not deserve a more proper answer than silence itself. The second is the silence of the lips, which is the silence that we speak <END>

<BEGIN> Endurance of pain and suffering can be one of the most difficult things for people to endure. It can be difficult to understand why they should endure such trials and hardships. But it is essential to remember that trials, hardships and pains are often part of the Lord’s plan of salvation. As Paul says, “all things are delivered unto me of God to be done.” (2 Timothy 1:11)

The first thing we must do, when we are afflicted or in pain, is to get a proper understanding of what we are afflicted for. And this is to know and remember, that these things are inflicted upon us, either for our own good, or for the good of others; that is, for the glory of God, or for the furthering of some godly design and work. And to remember that those that afflict or pain us, are often God’s instruments and servants, whom He hath appointed for this end.

And again, as Paul says, “Whosoever will, let him come: but let him come not unto me, for I am come unto all nations for salvation: but they that seek me, let them come unto me. (John 12:42)
